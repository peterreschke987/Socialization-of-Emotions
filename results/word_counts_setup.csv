Um, so his surprise was a big box and in the box was something really great, but George couldn't open it. He couldn't open it because it wasn't his birthday yet. And it was a birthday present. So George was very, very excited, but he had to wait a long time. So while he was waiting, he jumped up and down and he walked around and looked at this... the present and he shook the present and listened to what... any sounds that it made like jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.

Parent:		Oh, okay. Alright. Parent:		[Picture 2] This is a story about Sarah. Sarah was really excited. She had saved her money and she went to the ice cream store all by herself. It was just on the corner of her street, so it wasn't very far. But after she bought her ice cream, she tripped and it fell off her cone. And she was so sad. Poor Sarah. Parent:		It could be a space name. Parent:		[Picture 18] This is Jose. He is a big boy who has his very own room. He had just moved out of sharing rooms with his little brother, but he was not sure about the dark closet. He remembered in the daytime he had only put his socks and his shirt and his baseball and his basketball in the closet. So he knew there must not be anything scary there. But tonight when he was going to bed, it seemed very scary. Luckily, after he opened the door, he found out that it was Sully and Mike Wazowski coming to visit him. Parent:		[Picture 20] This is Gideon. Gideon is a big boy who has a job. His job is to take the trash out for his parents every week. Gideon doesn't like taking the trash out. He says that it's stinks. His mom says, yep. Sometimes we have to do jobs that stink and aren't fun, but that's okay. When you grow up, you can still do those jobs. Is Gideon going to do a good job? No, he's not going to do a good job. Parent:		[Picture 30] Oh, this little boy got lost in the big city. And he kept walking and walking and he was really tired. But then he turned a corner and there was a stinky rat. Oh, he did not like the rat at all. He really wanted to be home with his family. Parent:		Oh, it's a girl. Okay. So she walked down the street away from the rat and found someone to help her find her way home. Parent:		[Picture 11] This is Amelia. Amelia likes to sing and dance. She entered a, um, she entered a contest to perform on stage. The prize for the winning performance was a cute bunny. And guess what? Amelia's song and dance was the best.

Rebecca has a cat named Brownie, but Brownie jumped off the house. I'm not sure how Brownie got on the house, but brownie jumped off the house and broke her arm. Rebecca was so sad. She took Brownie to the veterinarian, the cat doctor, who put a cast on her and told Rebecca to give brownie lots of rest and love. Rebecca hopes Brownie gets better very soon. Poor brownie. Parent:		Hmm. Parent:		Yes. Parent:		For a treat? Yeah. Parent:		[Picture 13] This is Rachel. Rachel Loves to hike in the woods, but what Rachel doesn't like is snakes. And one day when she was hiking, she was enjoying all of the amazing scenery and the beautiful things that she saw around her until she heard a snap and a sssss. She looked next to her and there it was, a big snake on a branch right in her path. Rachel tried very hard to back away quietly and walk around the snake and get far far away. Bye snake.

We're going to share them with our friends later. Thomas is angry. He wanted to eat all the cookies and now they're up so high and he can't even get them. Thomas doesn't know what to do. I'll just sit here and be upset. Just wait, Thomas. Parent:		the end.  Parent:		[Page 26] Now, inside the castle, he sees a mommy. Who's playing with a bunny.

None-Page-4,None,4," Parent:		[Page 4] Oh! Why is this person angry? Parent:		What are those? Parent:		Food? Are those cookies? Parent:		And why do you think she's mad? Parent:		I don't think she can reach the cookies. That's kind of sad, isn't it? Parent :		[Page 4] I think this one is a boy. Mommy's not quite sure. It looks like a boy though, with long hair, huh? And a blue shirt. Khaki shorts. No Shoes! What do you think he's feeling? Look, there's cookies here but it says, ""No cookies."" What do you think he's feeling? Parent :		No cookies! How does it make you feel when mommy tells you no cookies? Parent :		No cookies. Does it make you mad? Hmm. Mad. All right. [Other dialogue] Not right now honey. Not right now. Parent:		Mean? Parent:		I think she looks mad. What's going on up here. Parent:		It looks like she wants cookies. She came in the room and the cookies are too high for her to reach. She's very upset about that. She was going to have a cookie, but it says, ""No. No cookies."" There's a sign on it - red sign -says, ""No"". Parent:		You see that? That means you cannot have it. Parent:		Oh yeah, they look so angry. I think it's cause look, the cookies are up here and she can't reach the cookies. It says, ""No touching"". Parent:		So she's not allowed to have cookies and I think she's pretty mad about it. Parent:		You would be so happy, huh? Parent:		Do you think you would be angry if mommy didn't let you have cookies? Parent:		Yeah, I'd probably be upset. Parent:		[Page 4] Oh no, she's mad. Why? Parent:		The cookies are too high. She can't reach the cookies, huh? Parent:		And look it says, ""No, no touching the cookies."" Parent:		Hmhm [yes]. Yup. Parent:		Yup. Next, so she's mad. Parent:		[Page 4] Oh my goodness. Looks like she wanted some cookies, but she can't have 'em. They said no cookies. Oh my phone's going off. How do you think she's feeling [Child's Name]? Parent:		Grumpy. Um. Parent:		What are your favorite cookies? Parent:		Those ones up there are your favorite? Maybe there's some chocolate chip cookies. Parent:		Oh know! Parent :		[Page 4] This guy is mad because his parents put the cookies up high and put a sign for him not to get them.  Parent:		[Page 4] Okay. Uh oh. Looks like mommy made some cookies last night and she put them on a plate on top of a really, really tall bookshelf. And Riley is very mad because Riley wants to eat the cookies on top of the bookshelf. But look at that sign. Do you know what that means? It means do not touch the cookies. And so Riley feels very mad because Riley wants the cookies, Riley's thinking about climbing the bookshelf to get the cookies, but then Riley remembers that mommy will disobey her if she does. So she doesn't. Parent:		[page 4] Woo. This is Susie. Parent:		Susie. Parent:		And I think she's feeling a little upset. Parent:		Looks like there's cookies up here, but she isn't allowed to have any of them. But she's not very happy. Cause she wants some cookies. She looks a little mad. Huh? Parent:		Yeah. Do you, how do you feel when you can't have a cookie when you want one. Parent:		You get feel kinda of bad too? Parent:		That is right? And that's probably why I brought her mommy and daddy were thinking, they said, we'll make these cookies, but you gotta eat your dinner. Gotta eat healthy dinner first, right? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Yeah. That's a bummer. Parent:		[page 4] What's happening on this page. Oh, she looks pretty mad and there is a, it looks like there's some cookies under a glass, um, cover. And she was hoping that she was ganna be able to have cookies. And she can't because there's a sign. The sign has a circle with a line through it. And that means no one's allowed to eat the cookies. Parent:		Because maybe they're for the birthday party, from the guy in the previous page with the present. And so maybe your daddy made cookies for the party, which is not allowed to eat them. And she's pretty mad about it. Parent:		[Page 4] Um, all right. Tina went into the kitchen to get some cookies, but it looks like the cookies have a sign that say no, do not touch the cookies.

She's very angry cause look, those are cookies and it says no eating the cookies. Her mom knew that when she came home from school, she didn't want to eat all the cookies and her mom said, ""no, no, no"" and put a sign on there. And she's really mad cause she really wanted the cookie. Okay.  Parent:		She's grumpy? Why is she grumpy? Parent:		So you can't have any cookies? Huh? She can't have any cookies?

She looks kind of like she's angry and her eyes are over here looking at that. And somebody put cookies out, but then they put a glass cover on the top and they put a circle on it and it says, ""nobody can eat these"" and when she came downstairs in the morning, she really wanted to eat those cookies. But because the sign says no eating them, she got very frustrated and her hands started to get tight and she just started to get very angry, like cookie monster when he doesn't have cookies and he's hungry. Parent:		[Page 4] Ohhh, so this is a story about a girl who is looking sort of mad and frustrated because, what's on the top shelf here? Parent:		Cookies. And her mom said she can't have any today. And that made her angry and frustrated because her mommy said no cookies. Hmmm. She's mad. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 4] This little girl wants cookies. But the sign says, ""No cookies."" So that made her feel angry. Parent:		[Inaudible]. Parent:		Yeah no cookies. Parent:		Yeah, but if she eats good food then she can have a cookie. She just has to pick something good to eat. Like chicken nuggets. Parent:		[page 4] Come here sweety. Parent:		What is this guy doing? What's wrong with him? He looks like he's mad. Yeah. But look, you see that out there.

She wanted a cookie and she couldn't get one. So she's mad. She's mad cause she couldn't get a cookie and she's thinking [Other dialogue], ""I'm not going to have one of the cookies, and I can't have a cookie cause they're all the way up here."" She probably can't reach them. She's like, ""Aw! I want a cookie!"" Parent:		Yeah, and she can't get 'em. Parent:		No, so she's mad. Parent :		[Page 4] Oh no. She can't have cookies for dessert.

Parent:		[Page 4] Look at this. What do you see? Oh my goodness. What do those look like? Parent:		Cookies. Parent:		I think this person is trying to get the cookies and there's a big sign on this. It has, it's a zero with an X in it and that means no don't touch. So I don't think this person is very happy about it. Do you? Parent:		Do you think that he's happy, happy, or sad? Parent:		Mad. Why? Parent:		Why? Because, because he can't eat the cookies. Is it a girl or a boy? Parent:		Why is it a girl? Parent:		Oh okay. Alright and where are her shoes?

Eww, it stinks. Parent :		[Page 12 ]This little girl, is sad because her cat broke her arm poor kitty. She just has to lay there. Parent:		[Page 5] Let's see. There once was a woman named Molly who lived down the street from Tabitha and she went for a walk every day and she usually brought her little doggy with her, but the doggy liked to run off sometimes. So the doggy is not in this picture, but Molly would take the dog for a walk every day and she would walk down the streets and she would look at the green grass and the neighbors' yards. And she would look at all of their flower gardens and she would watch the trees moving around in the wind and listen to the birdies chirping, like the finches and the hummingbird zooming through the air. And it always made her feel at peace. And one day, instead of smelling the nice green grass and the fresh air, she smelled a very bad smell and she didn't know where it was coming from, but it made her kind of want to turn around and go home. But she kept walking anyway, hoping it, that smell will go away. And then suddenly she saw it, there was this big silver trashcan full of rotten food that had been there for way too long. And it turns out the trash truck had forgotten to pick up that trash can that week. And that trash was sitting out day after day after day. And it was just getting rotten and stinky. And so she said, ""Eww, that's disgusting!"" And then she walked much faster to get back home. So to get away from the smell. And then she took a shower because she felt really yucky. Parent:		[page 5] Woo. Stinky. There is a big garbage can full of food and there's flies everywhere. That garbage needs to be taken out. Parent:		And put it outside in the garbage.. today's garbage day? Parent:		What day is today? Parent:		That's not garbage day. That's daddy's favorite day. But, um, yeah, that garbage can is full. We have a small garbage can too. And we take it out frequently. We have to keep it up, right. Because of Yanaka she eats, she gets into the trash. Parent:		So yeah, that she's making a face that she's like, Ooh, stinky. What else is stinky? Parent:		[inaudible] Right? It's a little stinky too. Parent:		[Page 5] Looks like she's pretty upset.

Parent:		Yeah, what? Parent:		Get this out of your face? Okay. Parent:		[Page 5] What is she saying? Parent:		Don't go there? I think she's say, pew, that trash is stinky! We better take it out!

Parent:		Sometimes flies come whether or not you have stinky garbage, but in this case it's certainly because of the stinky garbage. And she's angry that somebody didn't take the garbage out when they were supposed to. Can you see that? Parent:		She says, ""I told him to take it out. He didn't."" Parent:		Oh, why is she acting like that? Parent:		She's mad? What are those? Parent:		Cookies! Parent:		You love those cookies? Parent:		Hold on one second. Parent:		[Page 5] And this girl, she was walking by this trash can and she walked by it and her nose smelled something yucky. And she looked and she saw flies going all around it and some of 'em came up and they might've like touched her hand and she started to walk away and turn away from the trash can because she said, ""Eww yuck!, Disgusting! This does not smell good. I don't want to be near the trash can."" Parent:		[Page 5] Oh, this is a story about a mom who went into her kid's bedroom who had not done their laundry. And they mixed their laundry and trash together. And what is this? It's stinky! And she's kind of frustrated and mad because it's a stinky, stinky mess. Right? Bleh.

Parent:		That trash looks stinky and look at her face. Is it a girl or a boy? Parent:		Look at her face. I think she's disgusted. Parent:		Why would you, why would you be disgusted in this picture?

And then there's these flies and then I have to take it outside and put it in the big trash can with all of the other gross trash. I hate having chores.  Parent:		[Page 5] Ew, gross, stinky trash!

Parent:		No, we don't do that. That's a snake though. Do you think he's happy to see the snake? Parent:		No, I think he's super scared. Look at his face.

Parent:		Oh, you think that the snake is nice? Yeah. Why do you think the snake is nice? Parent:		Yeah, this is Michael. So Michael was taking a walk in the desert and he turns around by a tree and sees the snake. So he holds up his hands and he's just like, please don't he was like, please, please. I'm so scared. And all you can do was just freeze and hold his hands out and pray that the snake doesn't eat them. Parent:		[Page 28] Oh my goodness! [Child's Name] What's happening to this boy? I bet he was going for a walk. And suddenly the snake came out of the tree and went, ""Boo!"" The dog got excited about it too. [Other Dialogue] Let's see this next one. Parent:		[Page 28] What is that? Parent:		What does the friend think about that snake? Parent:		Scared. But are snakes scary? Parent:		No snakes are usually nice. Parent:		Yeah. Should he touch the snake though? Parent:		No. Snakes are nice, but they don't like the humans to touch them. They like to be free and in the wild. Parent:		That's right. If you have a pet snake you can touch it. But do you think this is a pet snake? Parent:		No. That's probably a wild snake. Parent:		Pet snakes like touches, wild snakes like no touches. Parent:		Yeah sometimes, that's right. Parent:		Okay. Not too many. Just a few. Parent:		Oh! Okay. Do you know anyone with a pet snake? Parent:		I don't either.

Yeah it was a nice snake. Parent:		Yeah. Do you think this is a nice snake? Or a mean snake? Parent:		You do? Would you want to touch it? Me neither. Parent:		It's just a what? Oh it's just a picture. Yeah, but what if it was real? Ew, I still wouldn't want to touch it. Parent:		[Page 28] This is Bobby. Bobby is walking down the path and saw a snake! He's kind of scared so he put his hands out, he doesn't want the snake to fight him. Parent:		[Page 28] look! Parent:		Is that a snake? Parent:		Yes! The same. But his is real so it's a little scarier and he was walking by and it came and snuck up on him so it really scared him. Parent:		Yeah like that. Parent:		Yeah. Is it the same? Parent:		Alright. Parent:		[Page 28] And this boy was outside and he saw a snake in the tree. ""Ah! A snake! Get away snake! Go home to your family snake!"", he said and he screamed. Parent:		Is he scared of that snake.? Oh my gosh. Better get away. Huh? Snakes are kind of scary. Huh? Parent:		When? Parent:		Oh okay. Parent:		Okay. Parent:		He's scared of the snake? Parent:		Oh no! You think it's going to bite him? Parent:		Oh no ahh! Parent:		[Page 28] Oh! Oh no! What is that!? Ahh! Do you think he's happy or do you think he's afraid? Get your finger out of your nose nose picker. Stop picking your nose! Parent:		[Page 28] What's happening with this one? Parent:		Oh he's walking and then he sees a snake! Have you ever seen a snake in a tree? Parent:		No. Where do you see snakes? Parent:		On the ground, huh. What do you do when you see a snake? Parent:		You back away. Look it. Is that what he's doing? Parent:		He looks like he's backing away. He says, ""Oh no! Stay back snake!"" What kind of snake does that look like? Parent:		Does he have a big head? Like a rattlesnake? Parent:		Kind of. You might be a scary snake. Huh? Parent:		[Page 28] Oh no. I think there's a snake and he's afraid. He doesn't like snakes. Parent:		Yeah. I don't think he likes it very much. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 28] Look at that! Look at that! Look it. Do you see that? Oh my goodness. What is that? Parent:		Yeah look at that. You see that? There's a snake on the tree and he's scared. No, no snake stay away. Parent:		[Page 28] And this is, do you want to say his name's Victor? Parent:		Him Victor. Okay. So one day Victor walking down the street and out of the corner of his eye, he sees something green. Parent:		It's a snake! So he's like, ""Ah, snake!"" And the snake says, ""I'm not going to hurt you. I'm a friendly snake"". And he says, ""I'm so afraid of snakes I just can't play with you!"" Parent:		And the snake says, ""But I like you. I'm going to lick you."" And he says, ""No, no, no, no. Don't touch me. Don't touch me."" Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		He doesn't want to play with the snake, does he? Parent:		The snake says, ""It's okay. I just want to kiss you!"" And he says, ""No! No! I'm so afraid. I'm so afraid."" But the snake reassures him and reassures him that all he wants to do is give him a kiss. Do you think that they became friends? No. [Other Dialogue]. Oh this one was fun, sorry. Next. Parent:		You think so? Yeah, this guy's on a hike. He's wearing his running shoes and he was walking outside and he went by a tree and he saw a snake and it went 'sssssssss' with his tongue and he was a little bit scared of the snake.

Looks like a friendly snake. Parent:		Yeah? Maybe he just wants pets. Parent:		Who knows? Parent:		They can be a little scary sometimes. Parent:		[Page 28] What about this story. Tell me a story about this one. Parent:		Hmm. Why are his hands out like this, do you think? Parent:		Yeah, I would agree. I wonder if this snake is a, is a type of snake that bites. Hmm.

He's going like this. Can you do that? Uh, I don't want to hang out with you, rat! You smell bad. Parent:		Yeah. It's kind of hard to hang out with stinky, yucky things. And you know, if a person is stinky and yucky, that's different than a rat because they're just an animal, that could bite you and give you yucky germs that have diseases. But people are different. Parent:		I did? I'm so sorry. That's kind of yucky too, huh? But you still love me? I'm glad. Parent:		[Page 30] Huh. Okay. Here's Marco. Marco was on his way home home school.

Parent:		[Page 27]. Parent:		This guy was really sad because he has his pet cat, who's his favorite pet and his very very best friend, got a broken leg from jumping too high and landing funny on it. And so the cat couldn't jump and he was hurting and so his friend was really sad that the cat couldn't play and jump. And he really wished that the cat was happy. But the cat was sad too, because he couldn't play and jump because he was hurt. So he had to stay with his leg casted for six weeks until it was better until they went to the vet to check it out and make sure the cat was better. Parent:		[Page 27] Oh, oh no!

Parent :		[Page 17] but this little girl went and bought an ice cream and she's so sad because it was hot outside and her ice cream melted. Awwn. Parent:		[Page 17] This is Missy. Missy was going to the zoo one day with her mommy and daddy. And she was so excited to see all of the animals. Her favorites were the giraffes and the zebras, and she couldn't wait to see them. And so they went to the zoo and they saw the giraffes and the giraffes had along necks and they were eating leaves. And then they went and saw the elephants and the elephants had long trunks and they were eating grass. And then Missy thought, ""I'm sort of hungry too. Do you think mommy will buy me something to eat? Because I have long legs, just like the animals that we're eating."" And mommy said, ""That's a good idea. Let's go buy some ice cream!"" And Missy said, ""Yay, ice cream!"" And so they're walking along and thinking about what animal they would see next. Maybe the monkeys with the long tails. But then Missy, wasn't watching where she was walking and she tripped over a rock and her ice cream fell right off the cone. And she was very, very sad because now her ice cream was on the ground. And then her mommy said, you know what, Missy, that was a mistake and I feel very sad that you lost your ice cream. So I'm going to go buy you one more ice cream cone, but you have to be careful this time. And then Missy was very happy again. Parent:		[page 17] Oh man. Sally got ice cream.

They had a big day at summer camp and their mom and dad said they could get ice cream. And as they were leaving, the top of the ice cream fell onto the ground and started to melt. And so she started to cry and it's pretty sad about it because she can't eat her strawberry ice cream. Parent:		That's happened to you before. Right? You dropped your ice cream. It's a pretty sad feeling. Huh? Parent:		You do drop your popsicles sometimes too. But what do we do? We can get a... Parent:		New one! Parent:		[Page 17] Once upon a time, there was a orphan child. They decided they were going to go out for ice cream. The little boy was so excited. He got his vanilla ice cream. Went to go walk over to the bench and he dropped his ice cream. What did the little boy say? What'd he say? Where is my ice cream? Where is it? Can you point to the ice cream? Ice cream. You're silly. The little boy started to cry. He wanted that ice cream so bad that he just couldn't understand what just happened. The little boy decided he would sit there and debate on if he wanted more ice cream. Parent:		[page 17] Oh, look at her pet. She just brought her back from the bed. What happens? Parent:		What do you think happened to the kitty? Parent:		Did she hurt her tail or her paw?

I bet the ants will like it though. The ants are happy I bet. They're like yay, we get ice cream! She could still eat the cone. Looks like a waffle cone. Parent:		You're going to eat it? Oh no! Now she's going to cry more. Now she doesn't even have a cone to eat. Oh man. Do you have another one for her? Parent:		Yeah. There you go lady, have this one. Parent:		Inside of there? Inside the ice cream? Oh, nice. Parent:		That'll make her happy. Parent:		Oh, perfect. Right up on there. Just like it never happened. Parent:		Okay.

Parent:		[Page 17] Aww, what do you think happened? Parent:		Sad, why? Parent:		His ice cream fell? Parent:		Would that make you sad? If your ice cream fell, would you be sad? Yeah, that would be sad. Huh? Yeah. You want to turn the page? Yeah. Parent:		[Page 17] Okay. Okay, let's, let's look at this picture here. What do we see here? Does that look like, um, a girl? Parent:		A boy do you think? Cause she's got short hair? Or I think maybe it's a girl. Parent:		Okay, well it's all right. Parent:		What happened? What do you think happened here? Parent:		So how would that make you feel if ice cream fell? Would you be really really happy? Parent:		You'd be sad. What kind of ice cream was it? Can you tell by looking at the picture?

You think it's a boy? Parent:		The boy's, well sad, huh? Parent:		Looks like his shoes are on backwards too. That looks like they'd be uncomfortable, right? I think that that's a problem. So no ice cream and your shoes are on backwards. Okay. Parent:		[Page 17] Let me tell you about Tom. Please, Let me tell you about Tom. [inaudible] a story about Tom. Okay, this is Tom. Look, Tom! He spilt his ice cream. Awh, he's sad, look at him. Tom is sad. And look at where his ice cream is at. His ice cream is on the floor. And he's sad [child's name]. Where's his ice cream? Show me where his ice cream is at. Show me! Where's his ice cream? It's on the floor? Look, he's crying! Look, he's crying. Look at him. Tell me. Come tell me the story about Tom. Look! Tom dropped his ice cream! And he doesn't have any money! He doesn't have any money to buy more ice cream. He's sad. I'm sorry, how long do we spend on each picture? Okay. Okay. Okay, let's go to the next picture Parent:		[Page 17] Who's this one? This one's mom. Mom got out of this, Mom got out of the store to go buy ice cream. And she was just gonna lick the ice cream and guess what happened? It fell. All the ice cream. Parent:		And now look, Mom's crying because she can't eat her ice cream! Parent:		Yep. Mhm. Parent:		Oh what happened to it? Parent:		It fell down? Parent:		We need to buy more. Parent:		Hmm that's true. Parent:		Was she frightened? Parent:		Oh. Would you cry if you dropped your ice cream? Parent:		[Page 17] Oh no buddy. You would feel very mad about this one. Look at this one. What happened? Come here. Come sit down with me. Parent:		Yeah, Her ice cream fell down because it's so hot outside that it doesn't stay cold long enough and it melted right out of the ice cream cone! Oh man. Gonna have to get a new one, but what if all the ice cream's all gone? Parent:		It's Not broken? Mommy just has it open so she can pull all the pages away. Parent:		[Page 17] My ice cream! My ice cream! My ice cream dropped. I'm so sad. Ohh, I think, I think I need a new one. How can I get a new one? Mommy, Daddy, can I have a new one? Parent:		[Page 17] Alright. Oh, oh no. One day the little girl was out to play. She ate - got ice cream. She was running really, really, really fast, and then her ice cream fell down. Parent:		""Oh no!"", she said. ""I'm so sad!"" Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		But what's she going to do? Is she going to ask her mom for more ice cream? Parent:		Oh. Parent:		Ah, and the mom says, ""yes! You eat good dinner"". Parent:		[Page 17] Go to the next one. Oh no. That's her favorite. She was eating ice cream and it dropped [inaudible]. Parent:		[Page 17] Oh no. You know what happened here? Parent:		What, they're so sad. Do you want to know why they're sad? Parent:		Yeah. Does this look like an ice cream cone? Parent:		Do we get ice cream from sweet cows sometimes at the Stanley. Parent:		Yeah! And we're always so happy that we get ice cream. But you know what happens sometimes when we get ice at the Stanley? Sometimes it falls. Huh? Have you ever dropped your ice cream? Parent:		You haven't? Would you be sad if you dropped your ice cream? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		Okay, Okay. We don't like talking about it cause it does make us sad when we drop it. Huh? Parent:		I've never dropped mine before, but I would be really sad if I dropped mine. That's why we usually sit at the table and eat it. So we don't drop our ice cream and get sad, like them. Huh? Parent:		Cause he dropped his ice cream. See right there. The ice cream fell off the cone, and that's sad. Parent:		Right there on the floor or on the ground. Huh? Yeah. Parent:		[Page 17] Oh look! It looks like the little boy lost his ice cream. He was probably at the park playing and he wanted some ice cream. So he asked his mom if they could go get an ice cream cone. And then they went and got an ice cream cone and then he was running back to play and it fell off of the ice cream cone onto the ground. And now he's really, he looks kind of mad. Would you, what would you, how would you feel? [Audio cuts for 23 seconds]. Parent:		I know. It, it's a different kind of storybook. Parent:		Okay go in there with your sister. Is that a good story? Parent:		Okay, Sit up here. Go. Parent:		Okay I'm done. [Other dialogue] Oh! So keep going? [Other dialogue] I can just go to the next one? [Other dialogue] Okay gotcha, okay. Parent :		[Page 17] Oh no, Julia lost her ice cream. It was too hot and it melted off of her ice cream. She was really upset about it, But she can't go get a new one because she doesn't have any more money. Oh no. Parent:		[Page 17] What happened? Parent:		She dropped it. Looks like it. Parent:		Yeah it's melting. But she dropped it, so it's on the floor. Do you eat food on the floor? Parent:		No. So that's probably why she's sad. She's like, ""Oh man, it fell on the floor, now I can't eat it."" So what should she do? Parent:		Yeah. She should probably clean it up a little bit and then maybe she can get some more ice cream. Parent:		Maybe. Will that make her feel better? Parent:		Yeah. Okay. One more. Parent:		[Page 17] Let's see whatever, oh, no. What happened? Parent:		She lost her ice cream. Okay. What's that? Parent:		I think it's, I think she's sad. Parent:		I think she is too. Is it a boy or a girl? Parent:		I think so too. Parent:		Right. I was saying she. You're right. That's what I, as assuming it was a girl, you never know. All right. Let's look at the next page. Parent:		[Page 17] Oh, what happened here? Parent:		Ice? Parent:		Did the ice cream fall? Parent:		Oh no! That's so sad. Do you think they're sad? Parent:		Yeah. I'd be sad if I dropped my ice cream, would you? Yeah. Hopefully they'll get more ice cream. Yeah. Alright, do you want to see what's on the next page? Yeah? Okay. Parent:		[Page 17] Oh, has that happened to us before? What was the story of us? We came home, we took a special trip to the ice cream shop. We walked all the way home with her ice cream cone, but the ice cream cone was getting melting and melty and we had to wear a mask so we couldn't start eating it. And then we came home and it was really melty. And you, took your mask off and right as you went to go sit down what happened to the ice cream? Parent:		It dropped. Do you remember that? Parent:		Yeah, it was so upsetting because you were so good. You did everything right. And sometimes accidents happen and it looks like that's exactly what happened here. They were very sad that they dropped their ice cream. What do you think will make them feel better? Parent:		A snuggle? Yeah. Snuggle this kid and make them feel better.  Parent:		Are we good to go? Parent:		[Page 17] Oh my gosh. What a day! What happened to her? Parent:		Well, what is that? It looks like she was in the sunshine and she dropped her ice cream. She's sad she dropped her ice cream! It probably had sprinkles in it too. Parent:		[Page 17] Uh oh, I spilled my ice cream cone. It fell right off. I was so sad and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to figure out if it's okay to pick the ice cream up off of the grass. But I think my mom would say no. Parent:		[Page 17] Uh oh, what happened here? Parent:		Oh, that's not good on a hot day, is it? New Speaker:		Yeah. Ow. Parent:		Ow? Yeah. Ready? Okay you ready? Turn the page? Parent:		[Page 17] Uh oh. She looks kind of sad. Parent:		Her ice cream fell down. Parent:		She is sad. Parent:		Yeah ,she needs to pick up the ice cream. Do you think she should eat it after it's been on the ground? Parent:		Yeah? Is that okay? Parent:		Sometimes. Parent:		Next one? Okay. We're all done.  Parent:		[Page 17] Uh oh, look at! She dropped her ice cream off of her cone. She looks really sad. Huh? She's like, ""What just happened? I was going to eat my ice cream, and it fell on the ground! And I really wanted that ice cream."" Parent:		Maybe she can get some more ice cream, huh? Parent:		[Page 17] What is it? What do you think happened? Parent:		The - it - what is that? Parent:		Ice cream? Where did it fall? Did it fall on the floor? Parent:		Yeah. It fell out of the cone. What do you think? How do you think that person feels? Parent:		Is that how you'd feel? Would you feel sad? If your ice cream fell on the floor? Parent:		You'd be fine? Yeah. Do you wanna look at the next picture? Parent:		[Page 17] Look at this one. Oh no. She dropped her ice cream. Parent:		Oh no. So sad. She's crying, she dropped her ice cream on the ground. Parent:		Oh no. Oh, that's so sad. Parent:		Yeah she was losing her ice cream cone and then it fell on the ground. Parent:		Yeah, okay, and then our next one. Parent:		[Page 17] What do you think happened here? Parent:		Would you cry? Parent:		Yeah, cause you'd have no more ice cream. Huh? Parent:		Aw man! Parent:		Look there's tears. I see tears. Parent:		The guy disappeared! Parent:		[Page 17] Okay, and then her? She had ice cream. Parent:		And what happened? She got sad cause she dropped her ice cream? Yeah. Aw, that's so sad. Okay. Parent:		Uh oh, she's sad. Look, she's crying. Parent:		Oh no. Do you think your mommy and daddy will get her another one? Parent:		Yeah. What kind does she like? What kind of ice cream is that? Do you think it's strawberry ice cream? Parent:		It was here favorite, huh? What're you doing? Parent:		Sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Don't play with those. Let's keep them closed, how bout that? Kay. So then do you think she was maybe running and her ice cream spilled? Parent:		Yeah. And she's so sad now. Okay. We're done.  Parent:		[Page 17] Ohh. Parent:		The ice cream fell. He looks very sad that the ice cream fell. It looks like vanilla ice cream. Do you like vanilla ice cream? Parent:		You do. What's your favorite kind of ice cream? Parent:		Vanilla, really? Parent:		[Page 7 or 22] It looks like they had all mud fight and got very muddy on their face and on their shirts. I hope that shirt doesn't ruin. Parent:		[Page 17] This girl dropped her ice cream cone and that made her so sad. Parent:		Oh, is it a boy? The boy dropped his ice cream cone and it made him so sad. There's, and that was the last scoop of ice cream. There's no more ice cream. So sad. Parent:		[Page 17] Okay. Oh, this boy seems a little sad. Why is he sad? He dropped his ice cream.

Parent:		Yeah. Why do you think that there's a tear? Parent:		Why? Parent:		He did get an ice cream and it dropped or it melted, but it was before they got to eat it. Huh? Parent:		Yeah. That would make me cry too. I want to cry because they lost their ice cream. That looks yummy. Huh? Parent:		That's so sweet of you! You're so sweet, huh. Parent:		[Page 17] Oh no. Ah, he's sad because he dropped his ice cream. Aww. He can't get another ice cream because the ice cream truck is already gone. He's so sad. Parent:		Yes. Parent:		I know. But look, it fell.

None-Page-9,None,9," Parent:		[Page 9] Oh, so umm. This little girl [Other Dialogue], your brother is going to make this a joy, here. Umm, okay, we can see it still. So, um, it looks like she maybe broke a vase. Yeah? She dropped it and broke it, which shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it looks like maybe someone isn't very happy that she broke that vase. Parent:		And she looks a little bit scared. Parent:		Well, because she looks a little bit afraid that she broke something and that she could get in trouble. Parent:		Well, that's maybe the person that she might be getting in trouble with. Parent:		Huh? Well, because he is there right there watching. It seems. Parent:		[Page 9] And then this little girl is scared because she looks like she dropped a vase of something that she wasn't supposed to touch maybe. And so she knows she's going to get in trouble. Parent:		No, she just nervous and scared that her daddy or mommy is gonna be mad at her for breaking something that she wasn't supposed to touch. Parent:		Yeah, because she's gonna get owies on her hand because you're not supposed to touch that. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh, look, this girl she's nervous because she dropped, she dropped a vase and it broke and she's a little bit scared that she's going to get in trouble, but I bet if she tells her mommy and daddy that it was an accident, then she won't get in trouble. Don't you think? Parent:		[Page 9] This girl is named... Parent:		[Inaudible]. Parent:		And she's really, really, upset because she accidentally, what do you think she did? Parent:		What do you think happened with this? Parent:		Yeah, and why do you think she's sad? Parent:		Okay. So she's really sad because this is her daddy and he saw her drop this [Inaudible] and she doesn't know that her daddy is actually going to say ""it's okay [Inaudible]"", so she's still so sad because she loves her daddy and she doesn't want to know he's upset. Parent:		[page 9] Yeah. Uh oh, it looks like she had an accident and broke that vase. Parent:		She looks worried. Maybe she's worried. She's going to get in trouble. Parent:		She did. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		If you broke a vase? Parent:		I might be sad or disappointed, but it's just a vase. Parent:		[page 9] And then, uh oh, it looks like this girl broke something. She looks kind of scared and like... That looks like a guy's looking at her. Parent:		Does she like look nervous or scared? Cause look, there's a broken vase.

Parent:		Maybe somebody was bullying him. That's not very nice huh? Parent:		[Page 9] Let's see what this one is. Oh... Uh oh. Parent:		it looks like an accident had happened. Looks like somebody accidentally knocked over the vase. Look at her face. She's like, Uh oh, Looks like an accident. Parent:		I don't know. She must've bumped it when she was walking by. Oh no. That's alright. It's an accident, right? Parent:		We'll just have to clean it up. How should we clean this mess up? Parent:		The... the vase. How should we clean it up? Should we grab... maybe a broom? To sweep the floor? Parent:		Yeah, just sweep all the broken pieces. That would, that would work. Yeah, and then we gotta be careful, huh? Accidents happen. But we still need to be careful. Parent:		[Page 9] Uh oh! Parent:		Yeah, it got broken, huh? We break stuff too, huh? It happens. Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. Look see, no shoes for her either. That's dangerous, huh? Parent:		Those are, we have to wear shoes when we break something on accident to clean it up. Parent:		[Page 9] Look! Uh oh! Parent:		Uh oh. Leslie, what did she do? Parent:		She broke a vase. Parent:		A vase, like that, where you put flowers in. She broke her Daddy's vase. Her Daddy said to be careful, don't play around that vase, because it will fall and it'll break. And she didn't listen. So now she's like oh no! Daddy's gonna be mad I didn't listen to him. Parent:		Yeah. She doesn't know, should she tell her daddy the truth? Parent:		Yeah, she should tell him that she broke it? And so she said oh no the vase is broken, I'm gonna have to tell my Daddy! Say, yeah, tell you daddy. Parent:		Want to turn the page? Parent:		[Page 9] Look at this girl. She accidentally, was - or she was playing ball in her house and she bumped it into the vase and it fell into the ground and she looks scared. Do you think she's in trouble?

Parent:		To drink out of the gl-, to drink out of the vase and she accidentally dropped it, Huh? Parent:		But accidents happen, right? Parent:		Yeah. Alright. Let's go to the next picture. Parent:		Uh oh, it looks like the little girl, she got in trouble. Parent:		She got in trouble, look what happened. She must've knocked this vase over.

I know what to do. I'll ask a grown up for help. The little girl went and asked her mommy, and she said, that's okay. We can fix it. As long as you come for us to help. Parent:		[Page 9] This one, uh oh, that looks like it's broken. Huh? Is that broken? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think that she broke it? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think she meant to break the vase? Parent:		Oh. She might've meant to break it, but I don't think she does cause she looks scared like she might be in trouble. Huh? Parent:		Why? I think she's probably afraid she'll be in trouble because she broke the vase. But it was just an accident. Parent:		Yeah, we can turn the page. Parent:		Okay done. Parent:		[Page 9] Okay, so a little girl was in the house, jumping around on the couch, playing with everything and she hit the vase in her mom's couch - by the couch and knocked it over. And now she's scared that she's going to get in trouble with her dad. Huh? [Other dialogue]. I know! Cause she doesn't understand [Child's Name] and I don't have anyone to help me, so just help me out a little. Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] This little girl is frightened because she broke mom's vase. Parent:		[Page 9] What's going on here? Parent:		She does look like she needs to go potty. Yeah. But what's that on the floor? Parent:		Yeah, I think she maybe accidentally broke it.

Parent:		You think...what should she do next? Parent:		Okay. Alright.  Parent:		[Page 9] Oh, what happened here? Oh, it looks like something broke.

And she's, she's afraid that she's going to make him mad? I wonder what wonder? Why is she scared right now? Parent:		[page 9] Alice was playing baseball in the house with her brothers. And guess what? Alice through the ball, trying to get her brother out as he was sliding into the base, Alice accidentally missed. And she hit her. Mom's beautiful vase. Alice was so worried that her mom was going to be mad. But guess what? Alice went and said, mom, I broke your vase. And you know what? Alice's mom said? Parent:		It's okay, Alice, let's clean up the mess together. Parent:		[Page 9] Alright, so this girl was at the museum. Yeah, and she was looking at all the nice things that they have on display and she was looking at this vase and she accidentally knocked it down. Parent:		It was an accident. She didn't mean to and so she's really embarrassed and everyone's looking at her and whispering. Isn't that sad? Parent:		She didn't mean to, it was just an accident. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Or, yeah. Why? Why do you think she's scared? Parent:		Oh, did she break something? Yeah. Or maybe she's embarrassed. What do you think? Parent:		You think she's more scared or embarrassed? Parent:		Speaking of animals. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		What happened? Parent:		Do you think - who do you think broke it? Parent:		No remember, that's not a monster. What do you think that is? Parent:		Is her dad watching her break it? Or is her dad break it? Parent:		You think her dad broke it? What does she look like? Parent:		She's scared? Parent:		You think she gonna get in trouble? Parent:		What would happen if you broke it? Parent:		You want to be the dad? Parent:		Yeah. Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. Oh no. That looks like a Peggy. Peggy looks very scared and frightened right now because it looks like she spilled the vase and broke it. Like, mommy's vase. Parent:		Yeah. Who's the shadow do you think? You think that's her dad or her mom? She's worried, she's going to get in trouble. Oh no! She looks, Peggy looks so sad and frightened that she's going to get in trouble for breaking the vase. Think she did it on accident though. Cause you don't break things on purpose, huh? Yeah, she definitely did that on accident. Parent:		[Page 9] All right. Who's this? Parent:		Yep. Mama. Okay. Oh, Mama was cleaning up the house and it, boom! She accidentally dropped a vase. And the vase broke into many, many pieces. She felt so scared that she was gonna get in trouble by Dad. That she had to cry and say, ""I'm so sorry, I broke your vase!"" Do you think daddy was mad? Or did he say, ""It's okay""? Parent:		He's happy. Because she was honest and she told the truth that she broke the vase. Right? Parent:		And she says, ""I'm just saying sorry, I know you loved that vase."" And daddy says, ""it's okay. Accidents happen. We'll get a new vase."" Okay? Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. Sarah dropped a vase. Maybe they were playing with Nerf guns and it got knocked over and broke. And she felt sad that she had broke it. Parent:		[Page 9] Uh-oh. What's that? Parent:		A broken vase. She's looks a little nervous that she just broke a vase. I hope she doesn't get into too much trouble. Parent:		Because she broke her vase. Parent:		[Page 9]. Uh-oh. Parent:		Looks like she's got to pee? Parent:		That's kind of how I look when I have to potty too, but look, uh-oh. Parent:		Her dad is coming. Looks like it's an accident though. She didn't mean to. Parent:		Did she break it? Parent:		Hmm, maybe. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. This girl knocked over a vase and she's afraid that she might be in trouble because she broke the vase. But it was just an accident. And accidents on purpose are okay. Right? Parent:		Yeah. Do we just have to clean up the mess if we accidentally make a mess? Parent:		Yeah. That's all. Parent:		[Page 9] Uh-oh. What do you think happened there? Parent:		You think she broke it with her leg. She bumped her leg into it and broke it? Parent:		Yeah. Alright.  Parent:		Yeah, you want to look at the pictures with me? Parent:		[Page 9] And then the next, or this page, it looks like the girl is maybe at home. And she was running through the house and going really super fast. And her mommy and daddy had told her not to. And she ran into a vase and broke the vase. Uh-oh, she's sad. And a little bit scared, now. It looks like maybe her daddy's a little bit, um, a little bit sad and upset. Huh? Parent:		Maybe. Parent:		[Page 9]. Parent:		This is Emily. Emily is feeling embarrassed because she accidentally broke something that was very fragile. Parent:		This is called a vase. Parent:		It holds flowers. And so she was going to give flowers to her grandma in the vase. But the vase broke. She accidentally made an accident. Parent:		It's okay, Emily, we all make mistakes. Parent:		I think she accidentally dropped it and it broke. Parent:		Do you want to say, ""It's okay, Emily. We all make accidents. Just try to be careful."" Parent:		[Page 9] Uh-Oh. Parent:		It looks like she needs to go potty. Elizabeth actually is scared because she broke the vase. Oh no. What should we do? Should we tell our moms so we can clean it up and be safe? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I see a broken vase on the floor. I see little pieces of glass everywhere. And this little girl looks like she might have gotten hurt? Or do you think she accidentally broke the vase? Parent:		Yep. She kind of looks like your sister doesn't she? Because she has red hair and purple shorts and a reddish pink shirt, right? Yeah. She looks like, she's afraid she's going to get in trouble, huh? Parent:		Yeah. Hold on. Let's see what the next picture is. Parent:		[Page 9] This girl is sad because she broke, she broke a vase and somebody is watching. Oh no. Parent:		She has to tell somebody, a big person, an adult. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. What did she do? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Is he still there? I know. What is that face doing there? Say go away face. Parent:		Okay. We'll switch the page since you don't like the face. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh no. This girl looks, I think she broke this vase. Oh no, she looks scared. She looks very scared that she's going to get in trouble with her mom and dad. Cause she broke her Mom's very, very special vase. Oh no, no. So sad.  Parent:		[Page 9] Okay. This girl. Oh, I see. In this story, this girl, she was playing in her house with her friends and she was in the living room where there was this really pretty vase and it was glass. So she was playing with her friends and they started a pillow fight, ""Woohoo, pillow fight."" Well, the pillow fight got a little rowdy and someone knocked over the vase. Her friends said, ""I'm outta here."" They went home. She had to tell her dad what happened. And she was feeling a little scared that he would be mad Speaker 1:		He was kind of disappointed, but he said it's okay. Still love you. The end. Parent:		That's the last one.  Parent:		[Page 9] Here's Jane. Jane was playing with the ball and the ball hit her mom's favorite vase. This vase, her mom used to put all the most beautiful flowers in that Jane and her brother William would go and cut outside. They'd bring their mom flowers and she'd stick them in that vase. And now, the vase got broken cause she was disobeying her mom by throwing a ball in the house. Parent:		[Page 9] Parent:		Oh, she has to go pee? I think she broke this. Parent:		Do you think she broke it? Parent:		What do you think, what kind of face does she have? Parent:		A sad face? Is she sad she broke it? Do you think she's going to get in trouble? Parent:		No. Who's this, do you think? Her daddy? Do you think she's going to get in trouble for breaking it? Parent:		No, I think she might be scared cause she broke it. Parent:		Oh is that a mom? Parent:		Oh, okay. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh, she looks like she's upset because the vase broke, huh? Parent:		Yeah. If you were to break the vase, how would you feel? Parent:		Yeah, she looks sad and kind of worried. Maybe like a parent's going to be mad. Parent:		[Page 7 or 22] What do you think is happening here? Parent:		Oh yeah. There is mud. Parent:		Oh, and look at the owie on the face, huh? Parent:		Yeah, maybe they got hurt playing outside. Parent:		[Page 12 or 27] Well, it looks like this kitty got an injury and the person's not super excited about it, but the cat doesn't look too upset. The cat is definitely watching the person. Parent:		He looks sad. Yeah, for sure. But thankfully the, the cat looks like it's on the mend. Looks like he's going to heal okay, huh? Parent:		[Page 9] When Sally dropped the vase, she was very embarrassed. But her parent was saying, that's okay. Parent:		[Page 9]. Parent:		What is she doing? Parent:		Well, let's look around. What do you see? What happened? Parent:		Is that a mad, is that mad? Parent:		Not sad or worried. She's upset that that broke. Parent:		[Page What's that face? Parent:		That's mad. Does this match? Parent:		That's the same face? Mad. Mad. Parent:		Why is he mad? Parent:		The doggie took his toy? Parent:		Do our doggies do that? Parent:		Our doggies don't take our toys? Parent:		Yeah. I remember that. But he's mad. Parent:		Is it milk? Like a milk bottle? Parent:		It fell? How do you know? Parent:		What do you think? Is the milk bottle in one piece or did it, what happened? Parent:		It broke. And how does she feel? Parent:		You think it's afraid? Okay. How about embarrassed? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 9] Oh, what happened? I think she dropped this and it broke. What do you think she feels? Parent:		You don't know? I think she feels a little embarrassed and maybe a little nervous that she's going to get in trouble. Do you ever feel like that? Parent:		Mad means cranky? Parent:		Where'd you learn that? Parent:		Oh, okay. Oh, that's the end. We did all of them.  Parent:		Stand by. We're gonna okay. Can you turn the page? Parent:		[Page 9] Uh oh, does she look like she needs to go potty? Once upon a time. There was a, a young lady who broke a vase. Oh dear. And she was very scared that her mama and her daddy were going to be upset with her. So she was very afraid. But you know what? Parent:		She did pray. Well, she prayed and she told the truth. She owned up to her mistake. She said, I broke this. I broke it. And her mommy and daddy understood. Cause it's always important to tell the truth. Parent:		Right. Even when something gets broken. Parent:		Well, and we probably can. Yeah. But it's more important to tell the truth because trust can't be put back together again. Once it's lost, that's a much harder thing. Parent:		[Page 9] Okay. Look at this. Uh oh. What do you see in this picture? What's that? Parent:		She dropped it. She looks kind of nervous about it to me. Parent:		It's a vase. Like what we put our flowers in. What happens if we break something? Parent:		We clean it up. Accidents happen. Huh? Parent:		She did it. Yeah. It's okay. Next one? Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] What do you think happened? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think she's going to fix it? Parent:		Or if she's going to go buy a new one. Parent:		Buy a new one? I think she's going to try and fix it and make it all better again. No? Parent:		How do you think she feels? What is that? Parent:		You don't know? I think she's a little scared that she might have hurt herself. Right? Parent:		[Page 9] This is well, Parent:		We'll call her... Katie. She was playing rough in the house and she threw a ball and she broke a vase. Oh no, she got in trouble by her Momma and Papa. She said, ""I didn't mean to, I'm so sorry."" And they said, ""You know that you're not supposed to throw balls in the house. You're in trouble."" She said, ""Oh, no, I'm so sorry."" The end.  Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 9] Uh-oh. Parent:		She hurt herself? Parent:		Yeah. Maybe she scratched herself on that vase when it broke. Huh? Parent:		It fell down and breaked it. Yeah. That's okay. They can clean up the mess. Huh? Parent:		[Page 9] What's happening here? Parent:		What's wrong with her face? What is she feeling? Parent:		She looks scared, huh?

Parent:		You know, daddy used to have a lot of trophies. Did you know that? They're at Nana's house. I don't have any more. What do you think she got a trophy for? Parent:		For winning a prize? Yeah you're right. Parent:		[Page 10] But I'm sure his dad will be able to help him. All right. And here it looks like a daddy's in the audience watching his daughter perform at an, a musical um, like concert. And she won a trophy for doing so well. And you working so hard and she looks very proud and so does her daddy. Parent:		[Page 10] So this is Brianna. And Brianna feels so proud of herself because she won the Olympic gold medal trophy. Parent:		That's the trophy and Brianna won the trophy for hard work, she was diligent, persistent, and reached her goal. Parent:		I told you, it's a trophy. Parent:		Yeah. A trophy is something you get. If you, like win a race or you do a really good job at something and you compete against other people and you can have the opportunity to win the trophy.  Parent:		[Page 10] All right. [Child's Name] Let's take a look at this book. Do you see that girl right there? Parent:		She's kind of standing like Superman does. Isn't she? Why do you think she's standing like a superhero? Parent:		You think she's wonder woman? Well she has her trophy there. So do you think maybe she won the trophy? Yeah, I think she might've won the trophy and look, there's someone in the audience watching her, huh? Does her face look happy or sad? Parent:		Definitely happy. Parent:		[Page 10] Okay. Look at this one. Let's look. Let's pay attention, excuse me. Alright, so we have a little girl who is winning an award and her parents are watching. Look at this, pay attention. Can you tell me what this is? Parent:		Is this a little girl winning an award? Winning a trophy? Parent:		[Page 10]. Parent:		Is she happy? Parent:		She won a trophy! Parent:		Is that face back?

Look at this girl. She looks proud. Parent:		[Page 10] Oh, this girl is wearing a pretty dress, wanna know why? Parent:		Because she's getting an award today. She won this big trophy for being the first in her class to write her name. Wow, look at that big trophy. So she gets to walk up on this big stage and all these people are watching. They're sitting down here watching. She looks around a little bit, like ""They're all watching me,"" but then she feels super proud because she got a really cool trophy. The end. Parent:		[Page 10] Okay. What is it going on with this pretty girl? I like her dress. Parent:		She got a trophy. What do you think she got a trophy for? Parent:		For driving a race car, that sounds fun! Parent:		And winning. Is she like Lightening McQueen? That's awesome. Do you think she feels really proud of herself for winning? It's nice to do something really good. Huh? It's very fun to, to work hard and do something really well. What have you worked hard at? What do you work hard at? Parent:		Like what? Did you work hard helping me clean today? Did that make you feel proud? Parent:		Did you work hard running around the neighborhood? That makes you feel proud? Yeah. Working hard at stuff can make us feel really proud but sometimes we have to rest too. And that can also make us feel proud when we take care of ourselves and rest. That's good too. Parent:		[Page 10] Here's, Mary. Mary was in a contest called a spelling bee. She had to spell lots and lots of words, big words, little words, hard words, easy words. And guess what? She won! She spelled them all. She spelled every single word perfectly. That's why she has the big trophy. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 10] She feels proud, because she won, the, the trophy.

What's that? Parent:		You don't know. Parent:		It's a shadow, that's good. Parent:		From her, It's her shadow? Parent:		Do you know what this is? Parent:		A golden, it's called a trophy. That's what you do when you win something. What do you think she won? Parent:		She won the trophy by doing, what? Do you think you can win a trophy one day? Parent:		No. Parent:		[Page 10] Oh, what's this individual doing? Parent:		Are they setting up a trophy or do you think maybe they just won that trophy? Parent:		I feel like they're standing up very straight and they're smiling. How do you think this person feels? Parent:		Happy. Maybe a little bit proud. Parent:		[Page 10] What do you see? Parent:		Actually, I think that's a trophy. That's something that you get when you win something or when you do something good. That's a trophy. And how do you think, what do you see? Parent:		You don't remember the word, that's okay. Do you want to say anything else about it? Parent:		Oh no thank you. Okay. Nothing else to say? Turn the page? Okay. It says stop here. We've finished.  Parent:		[Page 7 or 22] Okay. All right. Let's look, let's see what's in here. Parent:		Oh my gosh. What happened to that kid? What, what do you think he's feeling? Parent:		Who's this? Parent:		Oh, well that's, let's um make it up. What do you think? Parent:		This, to me, this looks like a story about a kid who fell down and got dirty. Do you think, do you think he hit his head? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		We get to make up our own stories for these, so, and we can decide whatever we want to have happen. We can choose. Okay? Alright, we'll go to the next one. That's cool. Parent:		[Page 10] Oh, I think that this girl got up and won a prize. What do you think? Parent:		A golden cup. You think that's her prize? Sometimes they call that a trophy. Parent:		Yeah. How do you think she feels? Parent:		Happy? Yeah. I mean, how would you feel if you got a golden cup trophy? Parent:		Amazed. Parent:		[Page 11 or 26] Wow. This kid's dancing with the bunny. Parent:		You think it's Easter bunny? Parent:		They're doing a dance together? If you saw the Easter bunny, would you do a dance with him? Parent:		You'd sing the bunny a scary song? Parent:		I really need to hear this unicorn gold song. Could you sing it, just a little bit of it right now? Parent:		Yeah. Will you give me a hug if I get scared? Parent:		Um, oh, did I already get all my hugs? Parent:		Oh man. Could I just have a one more hug? If I get scared? Parent:		So I get one more. Parent:		This is silly that we're talking to each other in the screen, right? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 10] Oh, once upon a time, there was a girl. Do you see the girl? And she wore a pretty dress with a belt and fancy shoes. Parent:		Like you! That's right. And she entered a contest. What kind of contest do you think she entered? Parent:		It was a purple contest. Okay. We can do that. Parent:		Oh, like, are you talking about her belt? Are we distracted by accessories? Parent:		Okay. So she entered a contest, a spelling contest to see who could be the best speller. And she won. She won the trophy. Trophy is something that you get when you win something. Isn't that pretty? Parent:		Like candy, like candy land game? When you win something, right? Parent:		Yeah. It's a thing. Parent:		[Page 10] And then this is, this is Jamie.

None-Page-6,None,6," Parent:		[Page 6] Oh, so this is a friend who, um, looks like, maybe woke up in the middle of the night cause they, um, peed through their pants. So they had an accident and got it on their bed and they woke up and they look a little bit ashamed maybe that they did that. And um, now they'll have to clean up the mess, right? Just like you do. Parent:		[Page 6] And then what's happening here? It looks like the little girl maybe wet her pants in the middle of the night. So she's embarrassed and sad. And she just doesn't want her daddy and mommy to be mad at her. So that's why she has that little sad face. Parent:		[Page 6] Hmmm. I don't know about this one. This is odd. There's some sort of goo or something on her bed and she looks kinda sad. Maybe she spilled something on it and she doesn't want to lay in her bed. She needs to clean it up. I guess. Parent:		I see the stop sign.  Parent :		[Page 6] Okay. This little girl in the blue shirt, uh oh. What happened? Parent :		Yeah, can you see what happened? What's on the bed?[Other dialogue] What's on the bed. Parent :		'ucky [[yucky]] on the bed. Did she accidentally go potty? It was an accident. What do you think she's feeling? Parent :		Sad. She looks embarrassed and sad, yeah? Okay. Parent:		[Page 6] So, what do you think is happening here? Parent:		Why is she sad? What is that? Do you know what I think happened? I think she had an accident. Parent:		Oh. I think she had an accident, and I think she peed in the bed. Yeah, do you think that's why she's sad? Parent:		Yeah, but that's does that happen sometimes? Yeah. And do we have to be sad about it? Do we have to be sad? No, we don't. We don't have to be sad, huh? No. She seems sad, but that's okay. Accidents happen, right? Parent:		[Page 6] What's this one? Parent:		It's sad, does it look like she peed the bed? Parent:		Oh she's sad. Is she embarrassed? Parent:		She's just a little bit embarrassed but she peed on herself. Parent:		Oh man. Parent:		A girl has a dirty bed. Parent:		and she look sad. Parent:		[Page 6] This is Amanda. And she also was getting excited for her first day of school. And she had slept all that night, having wonderful dreams about the school that she was going to go to and walking up the long hill with her lunchbox and backpack. And she was going to sing her favorite song the whole way. And she couldn't wait to see all of her new friends at school, but she was so excited that she slept really, really hard. And she didn't realize she had to go pee pee. And then she woke up and her bed was wet. And she was sad because she wanted to be a big girl. Cause it was her first day of school and she didn't want to wet the bed. And her daddy came in and saw it and said, Amanda, why did you pee the bed? You're a big girl. It's your first day of school. And Amanda felt so sad that she, that her daddy was yelling at her. She said, ""Daddy, I didn't mean to do that."" And her daddy said, ""I'm sorry that I was harsh with you. I shouldn't have yelled. It was an accident. I'll help clean it up and you can go get ready to eat your breakfast and go to school. And I love you, Amanda."" And then she felt better. Parent:		[page 6] Uh oh. This girl's name is drawn like... What should her name be? Parent:		Burke. Huh? Parent:		Barlow bink? Parent:		Okay. Burlow bink. Barlow bink had an accident. That happens huh? Sometimes. Parent:		It looks like she was sleeping and she accidentally wet the bed in her own bed, stop going to the bathroom and the potty. What, how do you think she feels right now? Parent:		Yeah. Sad, maybe a little embarrassed. Yeah, I think so. Parent:		Let's see what happens. Parent:		[page 6] What happens now? Let's find out. Oh, she looks pretty sad. She was playing in her room and she was playing with her new Tigo blocks and she got really excited. And then she forgot that she had to go potty and she had an accident on her bed. That's okay though. Right? Parent:		You have accidents sometimes too when you're, when you're playing and you forget. Yeah. And what do we do? We just clean it up and so that's what we can do.

Parent:		I don't know if she sees anything, but you know what happened? She had an accident. Parent:		An acci... It looks like she might've gone tt in her bed. Huh? So she looks like she just got a little sad because she tt'ed in her bed. Huh? Parent:		It was an accident. She didn't mean to and it just happened while she was sleeping. That's why sometimes we have you go potty when you wake up in the middle of the night. Huh? Parent:		I know you don't pee in the bed, huh? But if you had an accident, that would be okay. Huh?

Parent:		Yeah, where is it? Parent:		Right there. Parent:		Yeah, he fell on his face, he fell and scraped his face. And there's mud on his shirt. Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 19] This boy really wants a cookie but they're up high and a sign that says no cookies. Really mad. Want a cookie. Parent:		[Page 19] What's happening here? It looks like this person's not allowed to have the cookie. Do you think they want the cookies? Parent:		No, they don't want the cookies? Parent:		Yeah. That circle with the line. That means no. That says no cookies. Parent:		You don't think they're ready yet? Parent:		You think they're too hot? Parent:		Oh. What do you think that person's feeling? Parent:		Angry?

Parent:		Why did she not let him have a cookie? Parent:		Cause why? Parent:		[Page 19] Oh, what's happening here? You tell me. Parent:		Angry because why? Parent:		But what do you think this means with the cover over him and that sign right there? Do you think that means no cookies for him? It's like I'm blocking you from having cookies. Is that what's happening? Parent:		Like his mom said, ""You're bad. You don't get to have cookies."" How would that make you feel if someone said no cookies? Parent:		You'd be sad? Parent:		What do you think he is? He doesn't look sad though. Those arms tell me that he's what? Parent:		Angry. Errr. Okay. Okay. Don't be upset. Lets go on to the next one. Parent:		[Page 19] Oh yeah, look, see, it says he wants the cookies. He said, can I have a cookie? And it says, no. No cookies for you. And he's mad. Can you give a mad face? Can you show me your mad face? Parent:		Can we see your mad face? Oh man. Yeah, oh really? Parent:		Yeah? The mad face? And those are cookies. Parent:		Yeah? Next page. Parent:		[Page 19] Alright, this is Jayden. Jayden woke up at nighttime because Jayden's Tummy was hungry, it was going grrr. And so he goes downstairs and goes to the kitchen and he sees cookies. And mom said, no cookies for JJ. And Jayden's mad because he can't get the cookies. Parent:		[Page 19] What about that one? Parent:		[Inaudible]. Parent:		You're angry? Parent:		You want drink? Parent:		Hold on. Parent:		[Page 19] Look, he's super short and angry. Why is he angry? Cause he's not tall enough to get to the cookies! Cause the cookie jar is too high. You know how when the cookies are on the counter and you try to climb on the counter and you get mad, cause you're not supposed to do that? Yeah, he's doing that too! He's mad! He can't get his cookies. What the heck! No cookies! Just want some dessert. I'm not letting you go, you're mine. Parent:		Look at that! All done! No more stories. Where are you going? Hey, get back here.  Parent:		[Page 19] Urrgghh. I'm angry. All those cookies and you know what it says on the cookies? Parent:		Not allowed to take any of them. Urgh, that makes me angry because I want to eat some cookies. Urgh. So the boy went to grab the cookie. Parent:		And instead he decided that's not the right thing to do. I'm gonna wait until everybody else and then we'll have cookies together. Parent:		[Page 19] There once was a little boy who had just come in from playing. He didn't have his shoes on or his socks. And he was very hot and hungry. The little boy saw some cookies, but there was a sign that said do not eat me. The little boy got angry. He really wanted a cookie. I know, if I ask, maybe I can have one he thought. The little boy asked his mom and dad. They said, okay. And he got to have one cookie. He was happy. Parent:		What's in there? Parent:		Cookies! And that sign says no cookies for you. Parent:		He can't have a cookie, I bet he has to wait for dessert. Do you think he has to wait until after dinner? Parent:		yea and so he's mad that he can't have those cookies. Oh, he's so angry. His fists are in a ball. He's just so upset. Parent:		[Page 19] Alright. Okay. Parent:		Well this one, he's a little upset. Do you want to know why he's upset? Parent:		You don't want to know why he's upset? Parent:		Why? Well, listen, look, there's some cookies right here. Do you see these cookies? And they're covered up and they say that he can't touch them right now. It's kind of like the playgrounds, how they have a sign that say no playing. This says you can't touch them right now. Right? And that makes them a little frustrated. Huh? Just like us when we can't play at the playgrounds cause of the signs. Huh? Yeah? Okay. Parent:		[Page 19] This little boy. He likes... [Audio cuts for 19 seconds] got really mad that he couldn't have any cookies, but he has to, to clean his room and then he could be happy and he'd have a cookie. Right? That's what you do. When you want a cookie. You clean up all your toys and you do a good job and you can have a cookie. If you get mad then you can't have any cookies. Parent:		Yeah.  Parent:		[Page 19] What's this? What's going on in this picture. Parent:		Is that a boy? Parent:		Yeah, what is he doing? Parent:		Why is he mad? Parent:		Yeah, yeah I think you're right. Those cookies are up high and he's mad cause it says, ""Do not eat the cookies."" Kind of what that means, huh. Parent :		[Page 19] See here. Oh, he looks angry too. Why do you think he looks angry? Parent :		Looks like there's some cookies up here and it looks like, it says no cookies for you. He is so mad. Cause he can't have any cookies. [Child's name] he is so upset. Parent:		[Page 19] Hmm. What happened here? How does this friend feel? Parent:		Why do you think that friend feels mad? Parent:		He doesn't like that? Parent:		What is that? Parent:		You don't know what that is up there? Parent:		What does it look like to you? Parent:		I think it looks like cookies. Parent:		I don't think he's allergic to the cookies. I think he wants to eat the cookies, but the sign says, ""Not allowed to eat these cookies."" Parent:		I don't know. I guess they're for later. He wants to have them now, but he has to wait and that makes him feel kind of angry. What should he do? Parent:		He should wait? Parent:		And then what? Parent:		And then eat them when it's allowed? Parent:		Yeah, and then how will he feel? Parent:		Yeah. Probably. Parent:		What's this say? Stop, that's right. Stop and wait.  Parent:		[Page 19] What is this? Parent:		I don't know either. Parent:		Alright, Let's figure it out. Parent:		Mmm, what is this? Parent:		Seeds? Parent:		Like sunflower seeds? Parent:		Pumpkin seeds? Parent:		Sunflower seeds. Is she trying to get them? Parent:		Can she get them? Parent:		No. How come? Parent:		Knock it down and then she can have some seeds? Parent:		Ready? Parent:		[Page 19] Oh, he looks mad. What's over here? What are those? Parent:		Cookies. Yeah, and do you remember what the red line says, means? The red line means no. So somebody put a sign on the cookies that said, ""No, you can't have any cookies."" That made him pretty mad. I think he was going to get some and they said no. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		What? Parent:		Yeah, it's just him. They put a sign on it and walked away. Parent:		[Page 19] Oh, look here. What is on that plate right there? Those cookies? Parent:		See this symbol right here? It means ""No"". I mean, there's this lid on here and it says, ""Don't eat the cookies"". They look mad! They want to eat the cookies, and they can't! Parent:		I don't know. Maybe the cookies are for someone else? Why do you think they can't eat the cookies? Parent:		[Page 19] Look at this one. Uh oh, he's angry because look, he can't have the yummy cookies. Oohh, they put the yummy cookies away and he's angry because he can't eat the cookies. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Look at this one. Parent:		[Page 19] He's looking super angry! He's like, ""I'm gonna eat those cookies, even though it says no!"" He is the cookie monster! But a human version. Look at that. He's the human cookie monster. He wants all the cookies. He's going to get them all. Parent:		No? Okay. Well then he's gonna go away. Parent:		[Page 19] This guy looks like he might be kind of mad. Don't you think? Parent:		He's mad because there's a pile of cookies there. And there's a sign that says no cookies. He went to the bakery and the bakery... The person at the counter said no cookies. And he got really, really mad. He loves cookies and he wanted one so bad. It looks like it might be summer out because he has shorts and a t-shirt on, but he's... Maybe he didn't get cookies cause he's not wearing shoes and you're supposed to wear shoes when you go to a store, right? Maybe. Alright, let's go to the next one. Parent:		[Page 19] He wants some cookies, but it says no cookies 'til after dinner. He wants cookies now. Parent:		[Page 19] Oh, look at that. Those looks like, what? What does that look like to you? Parent:		Looks like cookies. Looks like they're not allowed to have those cookies and it looks like he is ""Grrr."" Parent:		He doesn't? Parent:		No. Parent:		So mad. I'd be so mad too. Parent:		If I couldn't have cookies, huh? Parent:		[Page 19] Alright. Oh. This boy really wants a cookie, but the sign says no cookies and he is so angry because he wants a cookie. Parent:		[Page 19] Ooh. My favorite cookie is there up on a high shelf and there's a sign says do not touch. Oh, I want those cookies. I'm frustrated. Parent:		[Page 19] Okay. And then here's a little boy who's, it looks like he's at the store. And he really wants, or maybe. Parent:		Maybe he's, oh he's not at the store, then huh. Where is he, do you think? Parent:		He's at home, he's at his house actually. And he's going through the kitchen. And he saw that his mommy just made a fresh batch of chocolate chip cookies. That look so delicious. And he really wants one, but she put a sign on it that said, do not eat those cookies. And he is not happy cause he really wants a cookie. So I think he's a little bit tempted and, to get a cookie. Parent:		[Page 19] Oh. Parent:		It is angy [[angry]]. Johnny's angy [[angry]], why is he angry? He's angry cause he can't have any cookies and he really wants a cookie. He wants a cookie now. What should we do when you're angry? What do you do when you feel so mad you want to roar? Parent:		Yeah. Take a deep breath, right? Parent:		[Page 19] Sure. That's the first picture. So we see there's a boy, kind of looks angry. Um, cause he sees cookies, but the cookies have a sign over the top, a glass thing that's covering it or plastic. And that means no, not allowed, no cookies. But he doesn't seem very happy about that. Does he? Parent:		[Page 19] Oh no. Oh no. There's a sign on the cookies that says don't or no, that means don't touch them, right? And that face on this little boy looks, what? Parent:		So mad. What do you think made him so mad? Parent:		Well, yeah. Wouldn't you want those cookies? Parent:		You don't want cookies? Parent:		Oh. Yes. After we eat dinner, we get dessert, right? Parent:		So do you think that this little boy didn't want to eat his dinner? He just wanted the cookies? Parent:		Yeah. All right. Let's see. Parent:		[Page 19] Alright, [Child's name], this little boy is so angry that he can't get the cookies. Where are the cookies? Look. Let's pay attention real quick, pause it. Can you look at my picture? Tell me about it. Look at the little boy. Parent:		[Other dialogue]. Parent:		[Page 19] Oh no. He's upset because he can't have no cookies and he can't reach because he's too small and the cookies are so high up and he can't jump and there's no stairs to help him get on top. So he's really, really upset. Okay. Parent:		[Page 19] I think this boy is angry. Maybe he's angry. Look, do you see those cookies? Maybe he's angry that he can't have any cookies. Cause it says no cookies. What do you think? You see the cookies? Parent:		[Page 19] Look at this boy, Parent:		He's pretty tall. He walked into the kitchen because he was feeling hungry. This boy looked around and he smelled something yummy. He smelled cookies. But on the cookies, there was a sign that said, no. That sign means no cookies. Now he feels a little mad. I really wanted a cookie. The end. Parent:		[Page 19]. Parent:		What does this mean here? That means no. You can't have any. How does he feel? Parent:		I think he feels angry cause he can't have any cookies. Parent:		Look at his hands. He's mad. Parent:		I don't know if he's going to punch it, but he's upset. Parent:		K.  Parent:		[Page 19] All right. Wow. The boy was very mad, Parent:		Because his mommy, was so mean. And she said that you [inaudible] couldn't have any cookies. Parent:		So, he looks like you and grabs his fists and grits his teeth. Yeah. Parent:		[Page 19] This guy. He looks really mad. Why do you think he's so mad? Parent:		Maybe because the cookies are way up high. I think you're right. And there's this. So these cookies are way up high and there's a whole bunch of them on that plate. And there's a sign that says no. Parent:		And he can't, and they're for somebody else. And so he's mad because he can't have any cookies. Yeah. Parent:		You think he's nice. He's just upset that he doesn't get cookies. Parent:		Oh, maybe he was at the girl's house and she was a nice person and she was going to give him a cookie. Yeah. That seems like a good idea. Then he probably feel not so mad, but maybe he should ask a little nice. Huh? How do you think he should ask? Parent:		Please may I? Yeah. Parent:		[Page 19] We're gonna look at some pictures. What do you see? Parent:		Everything? Why don't you point to something? Show me what you see? What are those? Parent:		Cookies and who do you see in the picture? Is there a person? Parent:		Where? Can you tell me about that person? Parent:		He looks angry. Why do you think he might be angry? Parent:		Because he wants the cookies. And, and this little symbol, does that mean no, no, you can't have them? Is that why he might be angry? Yeah, you think so. Parent:		He wants it? Parent:		And he can't have him, so he feels. Parent:		Okay. Should we turn the page? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 19]. Parent:		It's a boy that's mean? Yeah. He does kind of look mean. So once upon a time, there was a little boy who really wanted to have some cookies, but his mama said no cookies for you. And she put a big sign up and said no cookies for you. Do you think he liked that? Parent:		No. He got angry and upset because he wanted some cookies, but you know what? He chose to be obedient. Yeah. And he chose not to have any cookies. Even though he really wanted to. Parent:		What is that? Parent:		Yeah. He can't have those cookies and it looks like, he's mad because he can't have the cookies. Parent:		Would you be mad if you couldn't have the cookies? Parent:		[Page 19]. Parent:		Wow. Look, it says don't eat the cookies. See that circle? It says don't eat the cookies. He looks mad cause he wants a cookie. Huh? Parent:		[Page 19] The boy is mad because there are cookies on the counter. He can't eat the cookies because the sign says don't touch. Don't touch them. But the boy's very angry because he wants to touch them. But he's being a good boy because he's not touching them."," Child:		Where's the cookie? Child:		[Inaudible]. Child:		Cookies.

None-Page-18,None,18," Parent:		[Page 18] Woah! So this friend opened a door and there's some monster eyes at him. But I think it's a friendly monster who's coming to play. He just looks scary in the dark. Cause everything is scarier in the dark, until it's not. What do you think? He looks a little bit afraid, but I think once the monster comes out and looks friendly, it'll be okay. Parent:		Well, cause it'll probably come out the door or he'll go in the door one or the other and they'll have to meet each other fully. Parent:		Well, cause the more you get to know someone or something, the um less scary or the less, different that they might seem, you can find things to be friendly about. Parent:		Do you think maybe he's a little bit afraid? Parent:		Yeah. I think a little bit maybe. Right. Should we see what else? Parent:		[Page 18] Oh, this little boy, look, he looks nervous that he thinks there's like some sort of monster or something in here. Kind of like baby bear thought there was a monster under the, under the cellar door. Remember? And it was just the furnace, the fire. Parent:		But he looks like he's scared of something. He thinks there's a monster down there, his face and his hands kind of, Oh, look at, he looks, look at his fists, they are clenched like this. Hey look, look at his face. He looks mad because look, his mom put the cookies way up high, where he can't reach them. And she put a circle with a cross through it, which means like not allowed to touch it. So he's mad that he can't have the cookies. He really wanted a cookie. Parent:		What is that? Parent:		A monster's eyeball? Parent:		Yeah? Parent:		He opened the door and he don't like that. Parent:		Oh he was sleeping and then he opened the door when he woke up and there's that monster. Parent:		Oh! Is he knock, knocking? [inaudible] play imagination? Parent:		Oh no! Look at Fred. Fred found a ghost! [gasp] What is he gonna do with them big ol' red eyes? He can't see who it is. Huh! Poor Fred. he's so scared. Parent:		I know! Look at him. Parent:		Ah! Hold on. We gotta skip to this page. Parent:		Oh! What is he doing? Parent:		What is that? Parent:		[laughs] What is it? Is he scared? Parent:		Is he sad? Parent:		[Page 18] This looks a little scary. I don't know what it is. Who could it be? Parent:		I don't know, is it, it could be a monster. Do you think he's feelin? Well how do you think he's feeling? Parent:		Or scared, scared. Well he's not sure what it is. Maybe it's just a - a light. I'm not good at this story. Parent:		Yeah. Okay. So he says, oh no monster. Don't get me. Parent :		[Page 18] Ooh. What is that picture about? Parent :		A monster? Where's the monster? Parent :		Right there? Why do you think it's a monster? Parent :		It's in his house? Does he look? What does he look about it? Is he happy about it? Parent :		No? Parent :		He's sad about it? Do you think maybe he's a little scared about it? Yeah. Yeah. Do you like that picture? Parent :		You do? Parent :		Do you like monsters? Parent :		You do? Parent :		Yeah. Cause monsters are they real or are they pretend? Parent :		They're scary. Parent :		Here this page, we'll turn to this page. Parent :		[Page 18]This guy is scared because he went to to walk outside and someone did a prank on him and he seen something scary. So what happens when we get scared? Parent :		You see those? They look like eyes. Parent :		Yes, he is scared, Parent:		Where's the scary monster? Okay well actually he looks scary but he's actually really friendly. His name is... Parent:		[Inaudible] his name is [Inaudible] and he's actually really friendly! and this guy thinks he is scary because his eyes are red but really, when he comes out in the light he's really goofy and really really friendly, like... Olaf. Parent:		Yeah. So this guy is named John and he actually is a little afraid but when they meet their best friends forever actually. Parent:		There's no light but when he comes out he's really nice. Parent:		[page 18] And then here, woo he thinks that there's a monster in the closet. And so he opens the door and he goes, ""Ahh there's a monster in the closet. Saved me. But do you think there's really a monster in the closet? Parent:		So are you gonna help? And so he's afraid of monsters, but probably it's just super dark in there. And he thinks that there's a monster there, but it's really not there. It's in your mind, right? Parent:		Oh, just something red, maybe like a light, a light hidden in their closet. And so it looks, it makes like monster eyes. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Sometimes you make that face when you're mad and go urgh. I'm mad. And then let's flip the page. flip the page. Let's... no, I think this is the end of it. Stop here.  Parent:		[Page 18] [Child's Name]. Look at, Coco man. Coco. What noise does he make? Rawr. Coco man's gonna get the little boy. Say run little boy, run! Time to go, hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Who's that? Coco man. Is the coco man gonna get the boy? Get the boy. Parent:		[Page 18] Is he happy? Parent:		Why is he scared? Parent:		What's scary? Parent:		Something scary in his closet? Parent:		Do the eyes look happy? Parent:		Do the eyes look scary? He's scared. Show me your scared face. I think that's the last one.  Parent:		[Page 18] Let's see what's going on in here. See. Wow, what is that? It looks like some eyeballs staring at us. Or maybe somebody left the radio on. Maybe those are the radio lights. Maybe, I don't know. It looks like eyeballs. What do you think? Parent:		Should we close the door? Parent:		Close the door! Here, close the door this way! Parent:		Mira! Está el boy [Inaudible], dark room. He's so scared. [Inaudible] those eyes, so scared. Yeah? Parent:		Yeah [Inaudible]. Parent:		Okay. [Page 18] Ohh, is there a monster? Hi monster. Parent:		Yeah? Can you tell me about him? Parent:		Is he stopping the monster? Parent:		Yeah, so would you, huh? [inaudible] we don't let monsters get us. Do you wanna see the next page? Parent:		[Page 18] Oh, there's your monster again. Parent:		Yeah. Is he a friendly monster? Why is he not? Parent:		Yeah? Parent:		That's true. It isn't dark no more. Parent:		Yeah, I think he's got the lights on. What is he doing to the monster? Parent:		Oh, he's pushing it back in the closet, that makes sense. Parent:		See, that's why we don't have closet doors [inaudible], huh? Parent:		[Page 18] Now that might be a monster! He's scared. Parent:		But monsters aren't really real. They're just tricks. Parent:		It's a monster in the closet? Parent:		Ohhkay. Parent:		[Page 18] What's happening here? Parent:		You don't like ghosts? Parent:		What if it's not a ghost and it's really an alien? Parent:		It's a ghost? What's his hands telling you that he's feeling? Parent:		He says, ""Get back, get back, I don't want any alien ghosts around here."" Right? Parent:		What do you think his name is? Parent:		Stomp, Stomp, stomp. All I see are eyes though, I don't see monster body. Hmm. Parent:		[Page 18] Uh oh, look, there's a coco man in his closet. Do you see the coco man? Where's the coco man? Parent:		With his scary red eyes! He has scary red eyes, and he's saying, I'm coming for you. Parent:		No? Okay. He didn't say that. Yeah? Is that the coco man? Parent:		Wait, and he came? Parent:		And he got him? Parent:		Did he eat him? Parent:		Oh my goodness, that's a scary story. Parent:		[Page 18] Uh oh. Parent:		What's his name? Let's call him Mark. Mark is scared. He opened the door to go outside to go, to go feed the dogs. And he opened the door and he sees a monster and he's got scared and he can't go outside. Parent:		[inaudible] close the door. Parent:		Oh get away? Parent:		Oh what is that one? Parent:		A monster. Parent:		Go away? Parent:		Oh. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 18] Uh oh, what's happening? What's happening in this one? Parent:		There's a monster in the closet. And he sees the monster. Oh no, we got to close the door. Close the door, close the door! Parent:		[Page 18] The monster has red, glowing eyes. And he's making noises in the closet. Boom, boom, Bang, bang! You better open the door! There's secrets inside. Parent:		[Page 18] There's a scary monster in the closet. Rawr. I'm scared! Of the red lights in the closet, it looks like a scary monster! Rawr. Scary monster. No, it's not a scary monster! That's just the radio! Parent:		It's a scary monster? Parent:		Rawr. Rawr. Okay, I think we're done.  Parent:		[Page 18] There once was a little boy who had his own bedroom. In his bedroom, there was a closet, and in the closet there was a monster with bright red eyes. The little boy was scared. But it's okay, cause he's a friendly monster who just wants to play. The monster came out the closet when the little boy was going to eat, and said ""Will you play with me?"" Parent:		[Page 18] Oh my goodness. And now there's a boy and he's in a room and he opened the door and he saw something scary, scary eyes. That's okay. It's okay to be scared. Huh? He could just shut the door and then he won't be scared anymore. Huh? Close the doors. Say I don't like you. What do you think? That is? Parent:		A monster? I don't know. I don't think monsters look like that. Parent:		[Page 18] Yeah. Okay. Well this one, he looks a little afraid. Does he you look a little afraid to you? Parent:		Yeah. I think he's afraid cause he thinks there's something scary in the closet. Huh? Parent:		I don't know but if he's afraid of something in his closet, he should probably go talk to his mom and dad. Huh? Right? Parent:		I don't know what it is. It looks like there's some eyes. But maybe he thinks something in his, is in his closet and that's making him a little afraid. So he should probably just go tell his mom and dad when he's afraid and they can help him. Huh? What do you think? Okay. We'll do another one. No? Okay. Parent:		[Page 18] Oh no! This little boy is getting ready for bed and he's checking to see if there's any monsters in the closet or under the bed, and I think he saw one in the closet. So now he's scared and he's going to go tell his, his mommy and daddy to go look in the closet and get it. Huh? Parent:		Yeah, that's a little spooky. Huh? Parent:		[Page 18] Let's see. Alright, what's happening in this picture? Parent:		There's a monster in there? Yeah, I think you're right. He looks scared. Parent:		Uh-huh [[yes]]. What should this boy do? Parent:		Run out of his house? Yeah, that's a good idea. Close the door and then run away. Huh? Parent:		That's what I would do. Parent:		[Page 18] Okay, look here's a boy. He looks kind of scared. There's something scary going on in there. Is that a closet? Is it a dark room? I don't know. He looks kind of scared, right? Parent:		Scary eyes! Let's see. Parent:		[Page 18] What's happening here? Parent:		There's a monster in the closet? Do you think he's scared? Is he scared of the monster? Do you think monsters are scary? Or funny? Like in Monsters Inc. Maybe funny? Could be a funny monster in there. Maybe he's going to tell him jokes. I don't know. Alright, let's see what else there is. Parent :		[Page 18] Look at this [child's name] Oh, no, he looks so scared. Cause it looks like there's a scary monster in his closet. No, he's scared. Isn't he? He doesn't want to go in there. No way. I wouldn't want to go in there either. Parent:		What is that??

What are those! Parent:		Is that a monster? Parent:		Yeah. There's some scary eyes in that room. It's dark and scary and he can see the eyes, think he's afraid. He doesn't like that. Parent:		Are those angry eyes? They do kind of look like angry eyes. Maybe he can shut the door so he, won't be scared anymore. I think that would help. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 18] Look the door's open. And there's these red eyes and they look scared. Huh? Look, what are those red eyes in there? Is it scary? Yeah? Parent:		[Page 18] What's going on here?

So he is not happy. He looks a little scared, but maybe it's just one of his toys and it's just lighting up in the closet. You think that could be it? Parent:		Yeah. There's no monsters. Parent:		[Page 18] Okay. Oh. Look. Parent:		Is that a monster in the closet? Parent:		And that's a boy? Parent:		And he looks scared. Huh? Parent:		I would be scared too if I saw those kind of eyes. Want to go to the next one? Parent:		[Page 18] This boy sees some red lights. And he thinks, ""Is that a monster in the closet?"" No, it's not a monster in the closet. It's just some red light.

She's going to go to the castle. Do you think she'll dance inside the castle? Parent:		Yeah. Who's in the castle? Parent:		Is that right? Parent:		She's going to go there and she'll dance and she'll sing, she'll have so much fun. Do you think there's candy there? Parent:		Yeah, and ice cream. Parent:		Yeah, so fun. Parent:		Do you want to go to the castle? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 8] There's Susie. Susie is lost. She's lost and she's trying to find her way home to the castle and she doesn't have any shoes on. So she's saying, where's my shoes? I need to find my shoes, can someone help me find my shoes? I'm sad, I need to get home. This is my home where the castle is. I don't have any shoes to climb up the rocks. Can someone helped me climb up the rocks please? You don't like that story? Not that one? How about the next one? Parent:		Yeah? Parent:		And her pants? Parent:		What is she looking at? Parent:		What is that? Parent:		A castle? Parent:		Yeah. You think she wants to go there? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		But she can't? Parent:		Why can't she go? Parent:		The road's going that way. Hmm. Yeah. Parent:		[Page 8] She's singing and walking and she sees the magical castle. Parent:		There is a rock. Is it on top of a mountain? Parent:		I think the castle on top of a mountain. Parent:		[Page 8] La la la la, la la la la, walking down the road, to go to the castle. My friend, [child's name] lives in the big, big castle [inaudible]. La la la la la, here I come. Wanna play [child's name]? Parent:		No? Parent:		[Page 8] There once was a little girl who loved magical castles and princesses. She would walk along the path, singing her princess songs while looking at the castle. She wanted to spot the princess. One day as she was walking she saw a beautiful princess with long blonde hair and a fancy dress. Parent:		Oh, well this one, she's walking along the road and she sees a castle way up on a hill. Do you see that castle? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think she's like excited about it? Or she kind of looks like she's singing a song. Maybe she's just going for a walk and she's so happy and she's singing a song. That's what I think she's doing. Parent:		You want another page? I can put it closer to you. Okay. Parent:		[Page 8] Okay so this little girl is in her. This little girl is in her pajamas. Okay. There you go. There you go. This little girl is in her pajamas. I think she's dreaming about walking to the princess castle to meet the princess, and she has a long way to walk to get to the princess castle. Parent:		No she's not. So that's why I think that she's dreaming. She looks like maybe she's in her pajamas. Parent:		Yeah I think so. Parent:		[Page 8] This little girl is singing as she walks to a castle in Greenland. Parent:		Yeah, with no shoes. You are correct. Parent:		[Page 8] Okay let's look at this page. What's this girl doing? Parent:		At the castle? Parent:		Does she look happy? Or sad? Or, or what's - what's that expression on her face, do you think? Parent:		She wants to go up there? That's what she's thinking? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Yeah. Where are her shoes? Parent:		I don't know. Parent:		This is princess Esmerelda, she's walking down along a little road next to her pretty castle and she's looking up in the sky and it just looks so beautiful to her and she's just like, Oh my God, I love how the sky looks it's just so blue. The clouds are so white and they were healthy and cuddlyish and I just want to touch it. So she's just out taking a walk around to the castle. Parent:		[Page 8] Look at her. She's walking along. She sees a castle. Parent:		It is? Parent:		Is she the princess, or is she just walking by and she thinks that princess lives there lives there? Parent:		And the princess lives there? I think you might be right high up on the rock in the mountains. Just like, you know who? Parent:		She's happy? Why do you think she's happy? Parent:		I don't know why she has no shoes. I guess she just likes to run around with no shoes. Like you. Right? Why do you think she's happy? Parent:		Oh yeah. You think she'd be really happy if she went to the castle? Do you want to go to a castle? Or is it just little girl that like to go to castles? I know your sisters like to go to castles. Do you like to go to castles too? Parent:		Yeah. Okay. So you'd like, you'd be excited if you went to the castle? Yeah. Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 8] Alright. Oh look! She's going on a walk. Parent:		Yeah. What does she see? She see the castle? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Huh? Parent:		I don't know. What do you think she's doing? Parent:		Yeah. She doesn't have any shoes, huh? But she looks happy. Huh? Parent:		Alright. Parent:		Oh! Parent:		Her is happy? And what does she, does she wear shoes? Parent:		Where her shoes go? Parent:		Okay. What is this? Parent:		A kingdom? Parent:		She's happy about the kingdom you think? Parent:		Wait. No. That's too many pages, too many. Remember we talked about one. One at a time. Parent:		[Page 8] What's going on here? Who is that? Parent:		There's a castle! Who's this? Parent:		I don't know her name either. It's a little girl, huh? Parent:		What do you see about her? What do you know about her? Parent:		Oh you think she's going to the castle? Yeah. She doesn't have any shoes on. Why do you think she not wearing shoes? Parent:		She's not moving? No. She's just standing and looking at the castle? Yeah. What do you think she's thinking? Parent:		She wants to go in the castle? So she's looking? What do you think she's feeling? Parent:		She's feeling good? Like what? She made it to the castle? Parent:		No? Not yet, huh. Not yet? Parent:		Le'ts see another page? Parent:		[Page 8] Once upon a time the little girl was walking down the road. And as she was walking down the road, she sees a castle. Parent:		Yeah. When she sees the castle, she starts to think, ""I wonder what's in it."" Do you think there is animals? Or people? So, she says, ""Hmm, how do I get there? I don't know the road"". So, she keeps walking and walking and walking and decides, ""There's not a way to get there"". She says, ""Hmm, I wonder if I can climb the rocks."" Parent:		Why? Cause I don't see a road. Do you see a road? So, in this, so she decides since she can't get up to the castle, to make up her own story. When she gets in, she's gonna see... a puppy! And the puppy's gonna bring her a ball! And they're going to play fetch and have lunch. And then she's gonna run home and tell her parents that she saw a big castle and played fetch with the puppy. Parent:		Really! Does that sound like fun? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 8] And Georgia found a castle and it's made of glass and she's very excited. Wonder what happened to her shoes? You think she could climb up? She could climb up the mountain to the castle and maybe she'll meet a queen and a king. Parent:		[Page 8] Ooh. This looks like something you'd enjoy. What's happening in this picture? Tell me a story. Parent:		Yeah. She doesn't have her shoes on. What else is going on? Parent:		No, she's not angry. Parent:		Yeah. What is she happy about? You can do this. What is she feeling happy about? Parent:		Because she's standing outside of a castle and look at her. She's like, Oh, my, it's the most beautiful castle I ever seen. Parent:		Do you think that's what she's saying? Or what, what is she thinking? Parent:		Hmm. I wonder if I could go explore it. Do you think she could get into the castle? Parent:		[Page 8] Looks like she's walking along the path and singing and there's a castle up on the hill. Do you think a princess lives in there? Parent:		Yeah? Do you think she is the princess? Parent:		No. Maybe the princess' friend. Parent:		[Page 8]. Parent:		Is she- Parent:		Mm hmm, she looks like she's excited or dreaming or maybe imagining a big castle. Parent:		Mm, is she a princess? Parent:		No. That's a princess castle. She's not the princess, huh? Parent:		Oh, Okay. Parent:		[Page 8] Oh! This little girl is walking down a road and she looked up on the hill and she saw a beautiful castle. She thought, ""Does a princess live in this castle? I wonder if I can climb up that tall mountain to go look in the castle."" Parent:		[Page 8] What's that? Parent:		It is a castle. Who do you think she is? Parent:		The girl? Parent:		So you think she lives in the castle? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think she might be a princess? Parent:		Yeah. What's her name? Parent:		What is it? Parent:		Kayla. Is that what you said? Kayla? Parent:		[Page 8] But he's going to have to use some self control. Alright. And here's a little girl who's going walking along through England. Yep. And she's barefoot. Doesn't have her shoes on. And she sees a beautiful castle that looks so wonderful. And she thinks, I bet you a princess lives in that castle. And I would love to go and see the princess. Do you think she gets to go see the princess? Parent:		Maybe she climbs the rocks and crosses over the moat and goes and knocks on the castle door and says, hello! Can I meet the princess? And maybe she gets to meet the princess. Parent:		[Page 8] This is Stephanie and Stephanie feels like a princess. When she's older, she gets to go to the castle. But she has to grow into a big lady. When she's a big lady, she gets to go to the castle. Parent:		Those are mountains. So she can't cross the mountains to get to the castle until she's a big lady woman. Parent:		[Page 8]. Parent:		That's you! That's [Child's name]. Parent:		Are you happy and singing? Where are you going? Parent:		To a castle? Are you singing? What are we singing on the way to our castle? Yeah. Okay. Parent:		This girl is so happy. And I see a castle in the background and I see some mountains. She almost looks like she's in a dreamland, doesn't she? Parent:		So happy. Right. Do you think those are jammies or do you think that's her outfit? Parent:		And they do look like jammies. That's why mommy thinks that this is a dream and this castle is a fairy tale. What do you think? Or do you think that's her house? Parent:		No. Do you live in a castle? Parent:		No. Parent:		You want to be the king in the castle? Parent:		Aww, you're so sweet.  Parent:		[Page 8] Okay. Parent:		Cause, she's where's she going? I think this little girl is going to the castle. Parent:		[Page 8] What does she see? She sees a beautiful castle. She wants to go see if there's a princess in there, but she forgot her shoes. So she can't climb up the mountain to get to the castle because there's too many rocks. It'll hurt her feet. Parent:		No, the grass won't really hurt too bad. Parent:		[Page 8] Oh, wow. It's a girl out for a walk and she's barefoot kind of like you like to go barefoot. And what do we see in the background? Do you know what this is? Parent:		A castle. So do you think she's a princess or just a girl out for a walk. Parent:		A princess? Do you think it'd be easy for her to climb up those rocks to get to her castle? Or do you think there's a different way to get to it? Parent:		Yeah, that'd probably be smarter. Parent:		[Page 8] The little girl saw on her walk, saw a castle and she was mesmerized by it. Parent:		[Page 8] She looks surprised that she found the castle to me. What do you think she looks like? That to me, it looks like when you look at your Barbie dream house and you go, Oh, Mom! Or a new toy, you get so excited and you get excited. Parent:		Would you get so excited if you found the castle? Parent:		You wouldn't? Over here. Parent:		If you went walking with no shoes on, on a path and you saw a castle, how would you feel? Parent:		No you wouldn't! Parent:		[Page 8] Okay. Wow. This little girl is walking. Parent:		And she's happy. And she's singing a song maybe. Yeah. Maybe she's playing pretend. She's imagining all the things she can do. Parent:		[Page 8] What is in this picture? Parent:		And maybe a girl? Parent:		What is she doing? Is she singing maybe? Parent:		Does it look like she's singing? Parent:		Okay. Let's try the next one. Parent:		You're doing great at this."," Child:		[inaudible] she has no shoes on. Child:		I can't find my shoes!

Parent:		Well, some parents don't really like it when kids come home with dirt and mud on their clothes. Parent:		Well, cause, cause it's not the best for clothes, and so sometimes we want kiddos to take care of their things. If it's nice clothes, especially, and then sometimes we have play clothes that we can get muddy and dirty and that's fine. Most of your clothes are play clothes. Parent:		What do you think that man is doing? Parent:		You don't know? Parent:		You think maybe that's the person that she's waiting to see if she'll get in trouble for the mud with?

Trash can be a little bit smelly and stinky. That's why we got to take it out a lot. So that next time it's not as stinky. If it, if we let it sit there, Parent:		if we let it sit in there a long time, then it gets sticky. Parent:		I don't think we are not suppose to go backwards.I think we're done. Good job.  Parent:		[page 7] Oh. looks like another mess here. What do you think happened here? Parent:		Let's see. He's got some... Parent:		Jam all over their shirt. And They're like, Oh man, I just, I got some mud on my shirt. What am I going to do? And I don't have a clean shirt. Parent:		Um hmm. Something on his face too. Do you think maybe... Parent:		Scratch? Do you think maybe they were biking outside and then took a tumble and fell and took a scratch on his face. Parent:		[Page 7] This kid was out for a ride on their bike and they fell in a mud puddle. Then they got a bruise on their face and they came home crying and their parent there said, ""That's okay. I'll make you feel better because that's what parents do."" Parent:		[Page 7] Alright, who's this? Parent:		Yeah, cause it was kind of wet. Parent:		Cause remember she spilled her yellow drink. Parent:		Yeah, it looks like this girl's name is Amanda, and Amanda spilled some root beer on her shirt. Parent:		Well root beer, sometimes you drink it and it makes you cough huh, and then you get a little bit on your shirt when you cough? Parent:		Yeah. And she's going, ""Oh man"". She, ""Oh man,"" holding her head. Parent:		Because she spilled a little bit of root beer on her shirt. Parent:		I think she set it down cause now she's going to change her shirt. Parent:		Cause she got root beer on that shirt. She needs a clean shirt. Parent:		Why? Well we don't like wearing messy shirts. Parent:		[Page 7] Let's see. Oh man. Let's see. Maybe some, maybe some rugby or something. It looks like some dirt. Looks like they're playing outside, got a little dirty. What do you think they're playing? Parent:		Oh, spilled yogurt?

Would you get in trouble if you got dirty? Parent:		No? Parent:		He needs to go take a bath. Yeah, probably so. And maybe wash his clothes. Parent:		[Page 7] Uh oh, looks like this little boy, his name is Tom. What happened to Tom? Parent:		No. What happened? Parent:		Oh yeah. Did he have something on his face? Parent:		Yeah.

Must be a lot of poopy diapers. Gross! Let me get outta here. This stinks! Ugh! Yuck! Ugh! That almost smells bad as that time that my dad had to get that dead rat from the backyard. You didn't see that baby. When I got the dead rat from the backyard, you were at school. Parent:		[Page 20] Ugh, I hate taking out the rubbish said the boy. The rubbish is so stinky and smelly. Look at these flies. Hmm. I had better take it out though. It's not good to have stinky rubbish in the kitchen. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh. You know what this one is? Parent:		This is a garbage can, kind of like we have in our garage, you know, the garbage cans out there? And this one's really stinky, so it's got flies all around it. We don't let our garbage cans get that stinky, but he knows it smells and he's saying, ""Yuck!"" Does he look like it's gross? Parent:		Yeah, they probably should take out that trash. Huh? Should their daddy take out that trash. Parent:		No? Who should take it out? Parent:		Okay. I can take it out too. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, look at this boy. He was... Parent:		It's stinky, yeah, he was... Parent:		Yeah he was walking by and then he saw this trash, and it's stinky, yes. He's saying, ""Ew! stinky trash!"" There's a lot of things there that are rotting, and they smell bad. Yeah, so he's going to walk away. Parent:		Yes that's the bag. It's full, full of trash, yeah. So he's going to walk away because he doesn't want to smell it. Cause it's smells yuck, right? Parent:		Throw away your trash! Parent:		[Page 20] Oh man! This little boy was playing video games and his mom said you have to come and take out the trash because it's really smelly and he said, ""Well, I don't really want to because it stinks so bad. Do I have to take out the trash?"" And his mom said he had to take it out right now. So he's kind of grossed out because he has to take out the trash. Do you want to take the trash out? Parent:		Why? It looks so smelly and gross and you want it to stink in your house? Parent:		Oh, it's too heavy for you. Yeah right. So I guess that you're lucky then you don't have to take out the trash. This little boy's gonna have a rough time. Huh? Parent:		[Page 20] Okay. Let's see. Let's see. Oh, look at this. This is dirty, stinky, trash can full of trash. You know how you can tell that it smells? Cause these lines coming from it and you've got flies buzzing around it. And look, he blech, look at his face, blech, his hands say blech. Yeah, he's standing in that trash and he says, that's gross. It sinks. You can tell, am I right? Look how stinky that looks. Parent:		[Page 20] Um... oh, what's this? Parent:		Stinky garbage, and what does this friend think of that stinky garbage? Parent:		Yeah. What should the friend do about that stinky garbage? Parent:		The big trash can outside? Let the garbage men come and get it. Parent:		What else? Parent:		Yeah. Put the top on it, that would help too. Is that it? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, he looks grossed out too. Look at all that garbage. Does the garbage get stinky sometimes? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Yeah. If he closed the lid then that would probably help. Huh? But the trash is so full. I think he needs to go take it out so it can get picked up. Huh? Parent:		He doesn't want to? Yeah. He doesn't look like he wants to touch it at all. Parent:		But it's important to take the trash out. Huh? So it doesn't get stinky. Parent:		Yeah, and sometimes when we don't take the trash out, see the flies? Flies and bugs come around when we don't take the trash out. That's why it's important to do it. Even though it's stinky. Parent:		He is wearing shoes. That means he's ready to take the trash out. He just needs to do it. Parent:		No, he doesn't want to. No. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, that guy looks just looks like he does not like that. Parent:		That's stinky, yeah. Parent:		Yeah disg- Oh, disgusting. Yes. Parent:		Bleh. Parent:		Yeah. There's flies all around there. Parent:		That's gross. Parent:		We've seen trash cans like that too, huh? Parent:		We got to go shut it? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 20] This is Ben. He is walking by a trash can. [inaudible] It's got all creepy garbage in it and it smells.  Parent:		[Page 20] Ooh. What's this? Parent:		That's a trash can and it's full to the top of yucky, stinky trash. See those stinky lines again? Flies buzzing around. And look, they're going, ""Ugh! That trash is stinky!"" Parent:		Oh, I think that's a fly in the trash. Parent:		A big fly maybe yeah. Parent:		[Page 20] What is this stinky trash? Pew! There's flies. Parent:		Smells funny, ewww, stinky! Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, would you eat that? Look! Look and see that apple core right there? Look, look at the apple in the trash can. That's what mommy would eat. Parent:		Grr. Yummy apple cores! Trash! Yum! Do you think he likes it? Do you think he's gonne eat it? Or do you think he's saying, ""Ew, yucky."" Look at that yuck face. He looks disgusted. He's watching you pick your nose and he's saying, ""Oh, look at that booger. Stop!""  Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, we can definitely call him Oscar because he looks grouchy because of the stinky trash. Yeah. Is the trash smelly? Does that happen? Do we need to take out our trash? Oscar's mad because he has to take out the trash and that's his chore, but it stinks really bad and he doesn't want to do it and stop. Nope. We gotta wait.  Parent:		[Page 20] Ew stinky garbage! Yuck. He does not like garbage in his yellow shirt and lots of flies. Super stinky. Do you like stinky garbage? Parent:		No, I don't like stinky garbage either. Parent:		[Picture 3] Oh no there's a monster in the closet. Oh no, oh no. Let's close the door. Oh, we can't close the door. Is she going to run away? Or is she going to hide under the bed? What are you gonna do? Parent:		She's going to escape the dark room? I think she was running away from the monster. Turn the page. Parent:		[Picture 19] Oh no, I'm so mad. I can't reach the cookies. The cookies are on top of the shelf and I'm too short to reach them. So sad. How many cookies would you eat if you could eat cookies? Parent:		100 cookies. Parent:		Three Cookies? I like it. I think he wants three cookies too. And he's very mad. Parent:		[Picture 17] Uh oh, he's so sad. He spilled chocolate ice cream on his green shirt. His favorite color is green, just like [Child's name] favorite color is green. So he's sad. Would [Child's name] be sad if he got chocolate ice cream on his favorite green shirt? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Picture 10] Yay. She's so proud of herself. She won a trophy for winning the science fair. And she... Her mommy and daddy are so happy. She gets a big, giant trophy. Parent:		[Picture 23] Oh, I want to go to the castle, but it's a very long walk up the mountain. And it might be very hard to cause I don't have any shoes on. I don't think the boy can climb a mountain with no shoes on. Do you? Parent:		No, me neither. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Picture 2] Oh no. Her ice cream melted. See, she doesn't have any more ice cream. She's so... Parent:		Yeah, she's in the sun and she's so sad that her ice cream melted. I wonder if she's going to get a new one. Think she's going to get a new one? Parent:		What does that mean? Parent:		Stop. Alright.  Parent:		Okay. You ready? Parent:		[Picture 11]Ooh. Look at that girl. I think she found a bunny. Parent:		Yeah. The bunny has a bow so I bet it was a present for her birthday. Parent:		A bow. Is she happy? Parent:		Yeah she's happy. Parent:		[Picture 19] Oh, that boy is mad. His mom made some cookies for dinner tonight and he is not allowed to have them yet. So he is super mad. You like cookies? Parent:		[Picture 20] Oh that boy, he does not like that stinky trash. Parent:		It must smell really, really bad. Cause there's... Parent:		I think those are flies. They might be bees, but flies like stinky, stinky, garbage. Parent:		Uhum, they love a stinky garbage. He does not want to have to take that garbage out. Parent:		[Picture 13] That girl is scared of the sneaky snake. Parent:		You don't like snakes? Parent:		Yeah that green snake. She was taking a walk and that snake popped out and surprised her. Parent:		[Picture 30] This boy sees the stinky stinky rat and we know it smells bad. Cause there's flies flying around that rat too. Parent:		Well... Parent:		You think it's a girl? Parent:		[Picture 12] That girl is so sad. She's sad because her kitty cat has a broken paw. See how there's bandage wrapped up around the broken paw? Parent:		Well, maybe it got hit by a car or maybe somebody stepped on him. Not sure, but she had to take her cat to the vet. And now she's so sad because she can't play with him. He has to rest. Parent:		[Picture 18] That boy is scared. He opened the garage door and he saw two lights. The lights are really from the car, but they kind of look creepy and he was scared that there was a monster with red eyes in the garage. Parent:		Yeah. He should just close the door. Parent:		And then he won't see it anymore? Parent:		why would he be dead? Parent:		Oh that thing if; he closes the door. Parent:		[Picture 2] Oh no Parent:		This girl's crying. She just got an ice cream cone with her favorite, favorite flavor of vanilla. And she dropped the ice cream. It fell off the cone right onto the ground. And now she's sad. Parent:		She's going to have to go back and get a new one. Speaker 1:		Oh no. This girl is so angry at her dog because the dog chewed on her favorite stuffy. Parent:		it looks like it's a Teddy barrier. You're right. Chewed his arm off and she is so very mad. Parent:		We stopped. Now we stop. Parent:		And now they're going to tell us what else to do.  Parent:		Yeah, what is that? It looks like he's walking by and his mom probably told him to take out the trash, huh? Parent:		Yeah and it's so yucky and gross. That's like when I tell Bubba to take out the trash too. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 20] Okay. What's going on here? Parent:		[Other dialogue]. Parent :		What happened? I think, look it, he's like, Ooh, stinky trash. Parent:		He's disgusted at that. Look it's stinky, a trash is stinky. Stinky.  Parent:		Okay. All right. We're going to read this. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, I don't think it's going to show us! Parent:		That stinky garbage! Parent:		Somebody should take that garbage out. Parent:		Yeah. Throw it in the big garbage bin. Maybe that guy should do it. Parent:		Well, how would you get rid of it then? Parent:		Oh, a garbage truck could get it. Yeah. Do, where do the garbage men take it? The garbage man take it to a garbage, to a big spot for all the garbage. Can you imagine how stinky that is? Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, no. This garbage can is so stinky. I should empty it. But I'm not going to, someone else filled it up and it is stinky. Is that very kind? Parent:		No. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, icky. The trash needs to be taken out. I really should take out the trash. I don't want to though. I'm going to have to change, change the trash. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, and this boy, he was going for a walk one day and he was walking through the city and going through a park. And then he was walking into the store and he passed by this trash can that had this really yucky smell. It stunk really bad. It's been sitting there for much too long. And the flies are all in the trash. That's yucky. Huh? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 20] This boy doesn't look very happy. He sees the stinky trash. Do you see all those flies that are like lying around it? Super stinky. He's going ""Bleh. Yucky."" He does not like that. Do you think it smells very good? Uh uh. Smells bad. And he's sticking his tongue out, yucky. Parent:		[Page 20] What about this guy? Ew, look at that stinky trash can, do you see the bugs flying around the trash can. Parent:		Yep. Is that trashcan overflowing or is it, is there room to put more trash in? Parent:		Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of trash in there and it looks really old. Because look, you can tell, look at his face. He says, ""Ew, it's so stinky!"" Huh. Parent:		Yeah. His face says ""Well, yuck."" And he's trying to get his face away from there. Cause look, I see rotten apples. What do you see in the trash? Parent:		Yeah, maybe some dirty clothes. Yeah. And that kind of looks like a banana peel and I see some lettuce. Do you see anything else? Parent:		What else? Parent:		Eww. Yeah. What color is this guy's shirt? Parent:		It is yellow. Good job. And then let's see what else there is. Parent:		[Page 20] Aw, this one is stinky. Stinky trash. The boy is disgusted with all the trash. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, yuck. He's disgusted because look, there's so much trash in there and he can't close it and there's flies everywhere and it smells yucky and gross. Parent:		[Page 20] Uh-oh, stinky trash. He says yuck. I don't like this trash. I want to take it out to the dumpster. Look at all the yucky flies. Ooh. Yucky. Yucky trash. He needs to get rid of that trash immediately. Yuck. He looks like he does not want to be near that trashcan. He does not look happy. Parent:		[Page 20] Okay. This boy, he likes to go on walks and he loves to see trees and birds and squirrels. It's so nice to be outside. But one day he was walking and he smelled something weird. So he kind of sniffed, ""What's that?"" And he followed all the way to this garbage can. Look, it's so full. Oh no. It's stinky. He decided that he should ask someone to take it out. Maybe whoever worked there. The end. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, he smells the trash, look how full it is, it needs to get thrown out and he's like, no, no, I don't want to do it. You see all those bugs? Parent:		Cause it's stinky. There's probably dirty diapers. Food. What else do you think is in there? Parent:		Cause it's a trashcan. He doesn't want to change or he doesn't want to throw the trash. His mommy said he has to. Can I turn the page? Parent:		[Page 20] Okay. Ian's mommy made it to where he had to take out the garbage and when he threw it on the lid, it wafted up some stinky smells. He didn't like those smells. We went ""Aww."" Parent:		[Page 20] Uh oh, this looks kind of disgusting. This guy was walking along and he came across this big old open pile of trash and he's got like all sorts of rotting, gross gunk in there. Parent:		Angry bee and there's one, two, three, four, five flies. And he's like, ""Whoa, gross."" He looked like, he looks like he might need to puke because that's disgusting. He was like, no, thank you. I don't want any trash. Okay. Let's see what else we got. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, he says, ""This is gross!"" Gross trash. Eww. It smells. And it's icky and it's lid is all falling off. And look, look there's eyes. There's big eyes. Parent:		Yummy? Ew ew, ew ew. It's probably from a mouse. Do you think it's a mouse like Ratatouille? Parent:		He doesn't eat trash. You're right. Parent:		Yeah. What does he do? Parent:		He eats cheese. Parent:		[Page 20]. Parent:		Trash. Parent:		Flies. Cause he said you the trash stinks. Don't you say that when we walked by the trash and it's smelly outside? And it's all stinky and full and he was just walking by and he was like, eww, it stings. Yeah. Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, what do we see here? Parent:		Trash. It looks like it's stinky trash. What do you see? Parent:		Does he look angry? No. What do you think? Does he look happy? No. Does he look like P.U.? Yeah. So you think the trash might be smelly. You think he's going, yuck, stinky trash. Yeah. Okay. You ready to go? Parent:		[Page 20] Hmm. What is this? You see all the little flies? So once upon a time, daddy told this young man to go take out the, go take out the garbage and take out the trash. You think he wanted to do it? Parent:		He doesn't look like he has the kind of face that says he wants to do it. Cause it's smelly. Look at all that. Nobody wants to touch that. But his daddy asked him to, so what does he gotta do? Parent:		He's he's got to tell the place to go away. And then because his daddy asked him to take out the trash, he's got to take out the trash. Parent:		And then they, and then he went on to have fun and play once he got his chore done. Parent:		There's some more stinky stuff. Parent:		He's got to take that trash out. Parent:		Another one? Parent:		[Page 20] Look. The garbage. Is that the trash? What are these little things? Are these flies? The flies are around the stinky trash, look he's saying ""Ooh, stinky."" Parent:		Stinky. Parent:		[Page 20] This one. Parent:		The trash. Parent:		It smells. Can I tell you the story? Parent:		I think the boy thinks that the trash is stinky. Parent:		Eww! Ooh stinky! Parent:		[Page 20] Oh, look it. That's what brother looks like when he has to take out the trash. He doesn't want to, but mommy's gonna make him take it out anyways. Parent:		That's gross. Stinky trash, huh? Parent:		Two, three, four. Good job, babe. Parent:		Tell your brother, take out the trash, brother. Parent:		[Picture 23] Once upon a time there was a little boy and he was what? He asked his mommy if he can leave and go for a stroll. He goes for a walk and all of a sudden he sees the castle on a hill. He is surprised to see the castle; he's never seen it before. So he walks, he starts walking up the hill to the castle. Parent:		[Picture 20] Here we see a guy and he passes by a trash can. He does not like the smell. He's like, ew gross. Somebody needs to clean that up or close it. Parent:		So what he does is he puts the lid on the trash can tightly so it doesn't stink. Parent:		Yes! Next page, do you wanna flip it? Parent:		[Picture 2] This is Sally and she's sad. Sally is sad because she dropped her ice cream of her ice cream cone. Aw. She doesn't, she wants to [inaudible] ice cream. So what does she do? Parent:		She goes back to the ice cream man. Parent:		Yeah just like you, just like you. She goes back to the ice cream man and she asked the ice cream man ""excuse me I just came in, I dropped my ice cream. Could I please have another one please?"" So he gives her another scoop. ""Here you go, Sally. Enjoy. Have a good day"". Sally made sure not to drop this one. She was really careful. She eats it up and she's happy. Parent:		[Picture 21] This is Edward. And he had an accident. What happened? What do you think happened? He was sleeping and at night he had a potty accident. He accidently peed in his bed. Parent:		So him and his daddy changed the sheets. He went potty and then he went back to sleep. [inaudible] not to do it ever again. Parent:		[Picture 22] This is Bobby and he got his shirt dirty. Parent:		He got an owie? Parent:		I think he's embarrassed. He got his shirt dirty. I don't know how he did it. He probably was eating and he accidentally spilled. Parent:		Yes, that happens sometimes. An he's like ""Oh no. I spilled on my shirt"". Parent:		So he goes... Parent:		he goes and he puts his shirt in the laundry and then he.. it's clean. Parent:		[Picture 10] Alright, this is Gabriela. Parent:		She just won an award. She feels so proud. People are taking pictures. She can't wait to put it in her room. She is so proud. Next page. Parent:		No, no scary picture. Parent:		[Picture 24] What's going on here? I think he needs to go potty. Oh no, no. He doesn't need to go potty. No, I think he accidentally broke something. What's this on the floor? It's a vase. Parent:		He accidentally broke the vase. Parent:		And he feels really, really bad. He's like ""Oh no, I broke the vase."" He doesn't want to get in trouble for it. But sometimes accidents happen. All you have to do, all he has to do is go tell his daddy. Parent:		but then you told me, and then we fixed it. Parent:		So, um, Max went to go tell his daddy that he broke the vase and his dad is like, ""Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. It's okay, Max, next time be more careful. We'll fix it."" Next page. Parent:		[Picture 3] Oh no. This is Maria. She doesn't want to go into the room because she thinks she sees some eyes in the room. She thinks she sees something scary. Oh no, but it's okay because she knows there's a light in the room. Parent:		Yes? Parent:		Yeah? Well, we're not scared anymore because we don't put our fingers in there, right? Parent:		but Maria... Parent:		Maria, she went into the room and she turned on the light and she didn't see anything scary. It was just the alarm clock light. Next page. Parent:		[Picture 1] Yay says, Alicia. She just got a present and it looks like it's Christmas. She can't wait to open it. So yay, she says, and then she opens it up really, really fast. What do you think it's inside? It' a sled! She's going to go sledding in the snow. Parent:		[Picture 4] What's going on here? Oh there's some cookies. Look at that. Look at the cookies up there. yummy yummy yummy yum yum. Look. She... her name is Veronica. Veronica is like ""mom said I can't have any cookies until I eat dinner."" She... what does she feel like? Parent:		""I don't get no cookies... I want cookies"" Parent:		But it's ok, she just has to eat some dinner and then eat some... and then she gets some cookies after dinner. So Veronica eat some dinner and then she gets some cookies. The end. Parent:		[Page 20] Yeah. Okay. In this picture, he's making a face like it stinks. Eww. Does stinky garbage smell good? No? It looks like he's like, ah, it stinks really bad. Eww, gross. I don't want to touch it. Eww and there's flies and this looks like smell coming off of it. Yuck. He doesn't look very happy. Yuck."," Child:		Uh-huh. Child:		Uh-hm. Child:		Happy!

And who's this guy is this. Is this his dad? What's his dad saying? You got mud all over your shirt. What are you going to do? What were you thinking? The little boy looks like he actually has stuff on his face too. Maybe he tripped and fell and he got an owie. Maybe he wasn't playing. I feel bad for him. He's holding his hand.  Parent:		[Page 22] Uh-oh, this guy's like, ""Aw man! I got dirt on my shirt. I hope it doesn't stain."" He looks like he might've even gotten in a little fight or something. He's got some red on his face. Maybe he fell? Maybe he was riding his bike and he flew off and hit his face and scratched it and got mud on him. Hopefully he's not too hurt. Huh? Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. Parent:		Yeah, do you get mud all over you usually? Parent:		Not this time [inaudible]. Parent:		Oh, is that brother? Okay. Parent:		So what does his face tell you? It just tells you [inaudible], I like that answer. Ready? Parent:		Oh no. And he says, ""Oh my goodness, I can't wear this shirt for pictures. Oh no!

Parent:		""You know, these will be the best pictures ever. Don't be embarrassed."" Say, ""It happens."" Parent:		It happens. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh Oh, that's happened to you before. Parent:		It looks like maybe some chocolate or something. He spilled chocolate on his shirt. Parent:		Cause he feels bad. Cause he's like, Oh no. Now my shirt is all dirty. Parent:		I'm not sure what that is. Maybe he's blushing or something. Parent:		Um like when you get shy or, I'm not sure what it is. Parent:		I'm not sure. But he spilt all over his new shirt and his mom and dad are going to come and that was the shirt he was supposed to wear for picture day. Parent:		And now we have to look for a new shirt for picture day. Parent:		Mommy and daddy are gonna be so upset. Parent:		Yeah, because now we don't have a clean shirt and that was the shirt that we wanted to wear for picture day. Parent:		What you, you have that face? What kind, when do you make that face? When you do something you're not supposed to? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		It's an accident? Parent:		No, let's finish this. Parent:		Oh, no. And it was just an accident? Parent:		Yeah, accidents happen as long as we clean them up. Right? Parent:		Oh, it's still there, you didn't clean it up? Parent:		Okay. So let's go to the next page. Parent:		[Page 22] This was a boy who was outside playing with his friends. They got into a mud fight, was having lots of fun, but then he got smashed with the mud and he's really sad now, but he forgives his friends. Parent:		[Page 22] Look at this picture. What do you think is going on? Huh? He spilled something on his shirt. Right? What do you see in the picture? [Child's name]. Come on. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, and this little boy right here, something happened. Maybe he had chocolate pudding for lunch and it spilled all over his shirt in front of all of his friends. And so he became embarrassed and his cheek started to turn red and he wanted to cover himself up because he was nervous that his friends would make fun of him and that they wouldn't like him anymore. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, [inaudible] I ruined my favorite shirt and I banged up my face. Oh no, that was so silly of me. And so not smart. What should the boy do the next time? I don't know. Okay. Next page. Parent:		[Page 22] Now this is about a boy who feels embarrassed I think. Does he look embarassed? Parent:		Yeah, He spilled his chocolate milkshake all over his shirt, and that was a special chocolate milkshake. And it spilled all over his shirt and everyone was watching and it happened at school. So that was pretty frustrating and embarrassing. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh what happened, look? So he's a little boy and he's sad. And look, he looks what's on his shirt. Parent:		Yeah. His clothes are dirty from outside, and look, there's a person right here and it looks like he's, it looks like he's hurt. Did somebody hurt him? Parent:		He's got a booboo and he's holding his head. Huh? He might have a headache? Parent:		He wants a bandaid? What color is his shirt? Parent:		He wants a bandaid? What about his shoes what color are his shoes? Parent:		What color are they? Parent:		Tied to shoes, but what color are they? Parent:		Not fair Why is it not fair? Parent:		We're going to look at another story. Okay. Parent:		He's not going to Chucky Cheese? Parent:		[Page 22] And there's this other boy. Oh look, he dropped something on his shirt. Parent:		Yes like [Inaudible]. And now he's afraid. He's afraid that his daddy is going to be mad at him. Cause he, he got a stain on his shirt. You see that? Parent:		Oh no. He's a little sad. Thank you. Parent:		[page 22] uh oh. Parent:		Is that dirt on his face too? What do you think she is doing? Parent:		Maybe jumping in muddy puddles. Well, nobody issues are clean. but his shirt is dirty. I think he is saying Oh no. Parent:		Oh, good. Parent:		uh oh he has to go potty. Parent:		Boy o you think that he was in a hurry to go potty and accidentally broke the glass? Oh no. I hope he makes it in time. This one is watching him. Parent:		[ page 13] Do you think she's getting to hug that snake? Parent:		No she says stay back snake. You need to do [inaudible] hike? Parent:		Yeah that's creepy. Parent:		[Page 22] And this is Prince. It looks like he had a long day at school and he was playing soccer. And when he was playing soccer or something, he probably got kicked in the face with the ball. So he looks like he got bruises. Then he got mad. Cause he fell. So he looks like he's in pain. He looks like he's hurting my heart like this. And he just doesn't look super happy. He looks at, Parent:		[page 22] Yeah. Oh. And look at this person. Parent:		Oh no, there is that mud? Parent:		Oh no. And maybe they got a bruise. Do you think they got hurt? Parent:		Maybe this person got hurt? Parent:		What do you think? Do you think this guy had anything to do with it? Parent:		Do you think this, this big dark fellow maybe hurt this person? I hope not. I hope that's not what happened. Parent:		[page 22] this boy. He had some kind of accident and now he's all dirty and scuffed up. Like maybe he fell down in the mud. He looks embarrassed and he's worried to tell his dad, uh oh ""I got in a big mess, I'm sorry."" Parent:		[ page 24] This boy looks nervous and worried. You see his face. He broke something important. He's worried his dad is going to be mad. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, Johnny is so sad. He was riding his bike today and he hit a bump and fell. And when Johnny fell, he hurt his face and he got his shirt all dirty. He came inside to tell his dad, ""dad, I fell and I hurt myself. Can you please help clean me up?"" Parent:		[Page 22] Oh. I think this, this kid feels embarrassed too. Maybe, or maybe he has an injury. So there's redness there. Sometimes people's faces get red when they're embarrassed and sometimes, um, Hmm. But usually it's on the cheeks. I think that maybe that's a scrape. I think he might've fallen down and there's blood on his shirt and he's holding his head. I think he might've gotten hurt. And he's holding his shirt. Sometimes people do that when they're embarrassed or worried or just feeling really tense. You do that sometimes. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh no. Parent:		What is that? Parent:		That's mud. Look at his face. What do you think happened? Parent:		Oh no! So what do you think happened to him? Parent:		This guy hurt him you think? Parent:		So how does he feel? Parent:		Oh, poor guy. Parent:		I think he's holding his shirt too. Parent:		Yeah. But do you think he's gonna feel better? Parent:		How's he gonna feel better? Parent:		And do you think he's going to wash his shirt? Parent:		Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. Just like what happened to you earlier? You spilled all over yourself. Parent:		What does that look like he spilled? Parent:		It's, yeah, it's spilled on your bumblebee, but what do you think he spilled on him? Parent:		Yeah. But what do you think that is? It looks like what? Chocolate? Parent:		He spilled his chocolate on his shirt? Parent:		Yep. I would be upset if I spilled the chocolate on my shirt. Parent:		Because I'd want to eat the chocolate. Wouldn't you want to eat the chocolate? Parent:		A black one? Parent:		A black shirt? Oh, so the chocolate would show up on it? Parent:		It'd be okay? New Speaker:		Yeah. New Speaker:		That's a good reason to wear dark colors. So people spill on it, you don't know. Parent:		Like, Oh no. Parent:		He spilled the chocolate! Parent:		Now. Next one?  Parent:		[Page 22] Oh no. Johnny fell and got hurt! He scraped his face on the ground while he was playing with his friends and his daddy doesn't look very happy about that. Parent:		Because he should probably be a little nicer when he plays and he's got some blood on his shirt. So now they're going to have to try to get that stain out. Oh, poor Johnny. I think that's the name I gave him. Parent:		[Page 22] What's that guy do? Parent:		He's covered in chocolate? Parent:		Who's that again? Parent:		Oh no. Parent:		No it's red. That's like red. Like um, when sissy says she's blushing. Parent:		You know, that's what that is. Parent:		Do you want to talk about anything else in this one? Parent:		[Page 22] Here we go. Look at the pictures, okay? There's a little boy. And he looks like he's upset. What do you think he has the mud on him? Yeah. And then there's a shadow there too, but I think he looks very upset, so he doesn't look very happy today. I think he probably, he fell into a mud puddle. That's happened before, you like the mud puddles, huh? Yeah. Okay. Parent:		Where the guy go? I don't know. That's a good question. Parent:		Well, We haven't come to across a girl yet. Okay? Parent:		Let's go to the next one. Parent:		Oh, it looks like he's embarrassed. You see that? He got stuff all over his shirt. Yeah. Look it, he's embarrassed. Parent:		Yeah. Oh man! Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. What do you think? Parent:		Maybe he got, do you think he got in a fight with somebody and he got dirty? Parent:		Hmm. That's not good, not at all. You don't, you shouldn't fight. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. Parent:		He got a muddy. Parent:		He was playing in the mud. Parent:		He has a booboo too? Parent:		You think that that mommy is mad? Parent:		Yeah? She says change your clothes. Parent:		And go to the doctor. Parent:		[Page 22]. Parent:		Aww. Do you think maybe he's sad or embarrassed, maybe, that he got something on his shirt? Parent:		Maybe hot cocoa, yeah. Parent:		I think it's when, his eyes turned really red when he was really sad. Parent:		Maybe. I don't think so though. I think he just like, well maybe, he got hurt. What's this going on here? I don't know. Parent:		That's his dad. Do think his dad's happy or sad? Parent:		Or mad? Yeah, I don't know. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. He looks pretty upset too. He's got some dirt on his shirt. Parent:		I don't know. What do you think happened to him? Parent:		Yeah, maybe. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh-oh. What does that look like to you? Looks like, to me, he maybe had an accident or spilled something in the bed or maybe had an accident on the bed. Parent:		Accident. Parent:		Yeah, it looks like the boy maybe had an accident and there's the dad, and he feels sad. Parent:		Do you want to see the next one? Parent:		[Page 22] Parent:		Oh. That doesn't look good. Aww, look, he's got an owie on his face. Parent:		Oh really? Parent:		Mm hmm. Parent:		Got shoes on in the house and dad's coming, huh? Parent:		Yep, well alright it says we have to stop.  Parent:		[Page 22] What happened here? Parent:		What is that? Parent:		Mud? Now how did he get mud on his shirt? Parent:		Do you think from playing at the playground? Or playing outside? Parent:		Playing outside? And then he got mud on his shirt. And then what happened? Is he going to get in trouble by his mommy? He goes to the next stage. Okay.  Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, what do you think? Is that a boy or a girl? Huh? Parent:		It's a boy. What do you think the boy did? Parent:		Spilled? What do you think he spilled? Parent:		Juice? Parent:		[Page **] What do you think this is? Parent:		A human? You're silly. Parent:		[Page 22] What happened there? What do you think happened? Parent:		Splashed? Who splashed it? Parent:		You don't know who? What do you think that is? Parent:		A what? A booboo? Parent:		He got splashed by a booboo? Parent:		Which booboo? Parent:		[Page 22] We gotta take that trash out. All right. And then this little boy, he was playing hard outside and guess what he was doing? Looking for worms and bugs under bricks. Just like what you like to do. He was looking for worms and he was digging holes and he got his clothes all dirty and muddy. And his daddy, it looks like says, ""Come on, Sam, why did you get your clothes all dirty and muddy?"" Parent:		I know. Oh. And then it looks like maybe he, maybe he actually fell too while he was looking for worms. Parent:		And hurt his eye. That's not fun. Parent:		[Page 22] This guy made a messy on his, on his shirt. He must have spilled some chocolate milk. Parent:		Yeah, that seems to be his dad and his dad is looking at him. And Johnny, Johnny is feeling embarrassed because he spilled chocolate milk on his shirt. Parent:		[Page 22] This boy is so sad because he spilled chocolate on his favorite shirt, on his green shirt. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, what happened here? Parent:		Mud got on on his shirt? Parent:		And anything else going on? Parent:		He has an owie? Parent:		Where's his owie? On his face? Parent:		How did he get that owie? Parent:		He broke something? And then who gave him an owie? Parent:		Oh, from the binder pinchers gave him an owie? But it's on his face. Parent:		Did he get his face stuck in there? Parent:		Okay, [Child's name], let's turn the page. Parent:		[Page 22] Parent:		Oh no, he spilled on his shirt. Parent:		What, he's still there. Is he embarrassed? Parent:		Is that the dad? Do you want him to leave? Parent:		[Page 22] Oh no. He looks very tired and look how dirty his outfit is. Do you think he's sad? And he looks like he needs a break. Oh man. Maybe he would like to have a drink of water and sit down. Parent:		[Page 22] Let's see this one. Oh, this boy also gets to go on a, this boy also got to go on a big stage. Look, someone's watching him too. He was running around outside and playing with his friends on the playground. He went down some slides. He swang on the swings, swung on the swings and he had a good time. But then someone pushed him and he fell into some mud and scraped his face a little. He felt a little bit sad. Someone hurt him Parent:		[Page 22] Oh my goodness. What happened to this kid with his cool red shoes? Oh my gosh. I think he's embarrassed. Look at, his cheeks are red. My cheeks turn red when I'm embarrassed. What do you think he did? Parent:		What do you think that is? It's brown. What could be Brown that could spill on you? Chocolate milk. That's a fun idea. Yeah. I think he probably was drinking his chocolate milk for lunch and just spilled a little on him. Have you done that? Remember the other day when you were drinking your chocolate milk and the straw, you squeezed it, and it went, whoosh! That's probably what that poor little boy did. And he feels a little embarrassed. What do you think his daddy or mommy will do? Parent:		Yeah, I think they'll say it's okay. Let's take your shirt off. And look, he has a green shirt like you. Green, green. And I'll take their green shirt off, give them a nice new shirt. Maybe it'll be green. Maybe it'll be red and I'll wash this chocolate milk out. And it'll be as good as new! Yeah, no one needs to be sad. Accidents happen a lot. Parent:		[Page 22] Oh, here's Willie. Willie made a mistake. He had an oops. He spilled some juice on his shirt. What do you think Willie's feeling right now? Do you think he's feeling happy? Parent:		I think he probably feels a little sad because that's his favorite shirt. That was Willie's favorite shirt but he spilled juice all over it. That's a bummer. You have a favorite shirt too, huh. You'd feel sad if you spilled juice on your favorite shirt, it's your [inaudible] shirt. Cause you wear that one all the time. Parent:		[Page 22] Little boy was very embarrassed because he got mud all over his shirt when he was out playing with his friends. Parent:		Yeah, do you get all muddy? Parent:		[Page 22] Aww. Doesn't he look ashamed that he got something on his shirt. Parent:		Look, he's got big cheeks that are all red and sad and he's like showing it off to whoever, to the person in the shadow. But he shouldn't be so sad. Huh? Because people make mistakes. That's okay. [other dialogue]. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh, what happened? Parent:		That's a boy. Parent:		Okay. What happened? Parent:		Aww. Is he happy or sad about that? Parent:		He's sad about it. Parent:		[Page 22] What's going on here? Parent:		What is that? That looks like what happened? What did you do to your arm yesterday? Parent:		Did you scrape it? It looks like this poor boy has a scrape on his face. Oh my goodness gracious. That probably hurt a lot. And then what's this on his shirt? Parent:		The mud. So he must've fallen face first in the mud. He's looking like he's feeling a little bit less than wonderful. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh. Parent:		It looks like he got beat up a little bit. See, he has some, owies on his face and has some mud on him [inaudible] then maybe that's his dad and his dad's mad. Parent:		Yeah. Too. All done. Wait, am I getting stop?  Parent:		[Page 22] Okay. So what do we see here? Parent:		It's very dirty, is his shirt dirty? Parent:		Okay. And you notice anything else? No? So how does he, how do you think he feels? Parent:		Happy? Okay. Are you done with this one? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 22] Uh oh, so this little boy went out and got all muddy. He was having a good time outside. He was having a very good time outside, but he got himself all dirty. And he doesn't want to tell his mama and daddy, did he. Cause they probably told them not to be in the mud. Yep. But what's important? Parent:		Telling the truth. And he told them the truth and it was all right, because laundry detergent gets rid of a lot of things, and cleans our clothes. So it was okay. It was mostly important that he told the truth about getting his clothes dirty. Parent:		[Page 22] And then I don't know what's wrong with him, Jamie? I think he's embarrassed.

Parent:		[Page 25] What about here? What's going on? Parent:		Yeah, he won a trophy. He looks like he's proud. Parent:		Of himself or whoever won the trophy. What do you think?

And he's looking at him. The trophy, took a deep breath. I think he feels proud of himself. He must have worked really hard to get that trophy. What do you think? Parent:		Hm, yeah, some people don't do such a good job. Can you have a seat please? Parent:		[Page 25] Oh, this guy looks super proud. Look at that. So, I see the shape of a person here. Um, and then there's a trophy on the table and this person has chest out, hands on hips, head high and a little bit of a smile. That's how people stand when they're feeling proud, when they did something really good or really difficult. And, um, it was really hard, but they did it! Here ya go. Yeah. So I wonder if he gave a speech and he was really worried about giving the speech. Um, but he did it anyway. And so then he felt really proud. Parent:		[Page 25] Alright. So one day at work, this guy walks in and he realizes they're given an award ceremony. Parent:		Do you know what an award ceremony is? Parent:		Do you?

We all win, right? Parent:		Yeah. What color is that trophy? Parent:		It's a yellow trophy. And, he has a blue shirt on so that he, you can see it when he holds the trophy. Parent:		Cause if he had a yellow shirt on you wouldn't be able to see the yellow trophy when he holds it. Right? Parent:		Right. Okay. Parent:		[Page 25] Ooh, this boy looks very proud of himself. He must've just won that trophy for doing something! Parent:		Look, I think he won the spelling bee. That means he could spell all the words that they asked him to.

And he was walking to school with his backpack and his lunchbox, but then suddenly he looked down and he was in his pajamas and his backpack and lunchbox were gone. He said, that's really strange. And then he looked back up and his school had turned into a castle and he thought that's even more strange. I thought I was going to school. What is going on? And then he woke up and he realized it had all been a dream. Parent:		[Page 23] Okay. What should we name him? Todd? Parent:		Todd. It looks like he's taking a walk down a path near castle, a castle on a huge hill where the king and queen live. Maybe he's singing about his princess up there. I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss, like that? Oh he's barefoot, so he must not live in the castle. Huh? He probably lives in the village. Parent:		Yeah. Okay. Parent:		He does need shoes.

This guy's like, ""Woo-hoo! Look at this beautiful castle."" He's taking a walk barefoot - interesting -and he looks up into the top of that hill and he sees the castle, and I bet he's thinking, ""What is in that castle? I would love to see what's in there."" He looks like he might want to explore. Parent:		Yeah. Parent :		It looks like he's in his pajamas. He doesn't have any shoes. he shouldn't [inaudible] be walking without shoes on. But those look like pajamas huh? What's that? Parent :		It looks like a castle maybe he's going to go try to be one of the knights of the round table. King Arthur. And a quest for Camelot. Parent:		[Page 23] Oh, what is he looking at? Parent:		Two doors? What, And then maybe he's dreaming and in the dream he's dreaming that he's going to a castle and he's gonna live in the castle as the new prince. Parent:		A zombie princess? Parent:		Oh, okay, That's gonna be scary. Parent:		But he looks happy. He sees the big, big castle. Parent:		That's why I think he's sleeping and he's dreaming because he's dreaming and he's walking through the world cause he doesn't sleep with shoes on. Do you sleep with shoes on? No. Yeah, I think so. Next one? Parent:		You want to flip it? Okay. Parent:		[Page 23] This boy is having a dream, pretending that he a prince, and that's his castle and he's singing a song. He's so happy. Parent:		[Page 23] What's he doing? Parent:		He's happy to go there? Where did he go? What is that? Parent:		It's a house? Parent:		I think he's traveling to a castle. No? Okay. Sorry. Alright. Parent:		[Page 23] This little boy was walking and he had some, a shirt on and some pants on, but he didn't have his shoes on, and he was walking around. Maybe he was lost or maybe he went and he lost his shoes and they got all wet and they were in the river and they, um, he needed them to dry. And so when they started to dry, he started walking around and he discovered that there was a castle up there and with the castle... oh, and then... Parent:		It looks like he might be dreaming. I'm dreaming of a castle, walking towards the castle. Parent:		[Page 23] And then once upon a time, this boy had a special dream and he dreamt that he was walking down a path and there was green grass all around and up to, when he looked up, he saw a cliff with a castle on top of it. And he dreamt that he skipped all the way to the castle and had lunch with the King and queen. And they also served him tea and biscuits. Mmm. Parent:		What a fun dream. Okay. Parent:		[Page 23] And there's this little boy, he's walking, he's... Parent:		Yes he's happy, and he's walking down this path. He's maybe going to this castle where he's happy to see what's inside. It's on top of this big rock. You see that? There's grass all over and he's walking and looking up at the castle. Wait. Parent:		he sees the castle. Look he is going on an adventure. But, where are his shoes? Parent:		Maybe he lost them. Is he silly like you? No shoes on to the castle. It looks like maybe he is singing. Parent:		[page 23] This is a boy and he's taken a walk, not got any shoes. He sees a castle up there, high on that rock Hill. Parent:		[Page 23] Oh, I think this kid is in her PJs. And they're walking along a yellow magic road and they come to a beautiful big mountain with a beautiful crystal castle. I think this kid is having a really good dream. It looks like he's in his PJ's. And there's a beautiful castle in a beautiful place with a magic road. What do you think? Parent:		What would be in your dream? Parent:		Sit up please. Bananas? Parent:		[Page 23] Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Ezra, and Ezra was walking along the path and he saw a big castle up on the top of the mountain, as Ezra was so excited. He said, I wonder what's up in that castle. Let's go check it out. So Ezra went up the mountain and he opened the doors to the castle. And what do you think he found inside? Parent:		He found a dragon eating pancakes. Parent:		Isn't that so silly. Parent:		[Page 23] Oh, hey! Here's a kid. Looks like pajamas walking along and there's a castle. Hmm. Parent:		Yeah. I think it might be an imaginary castle. I think you're right. I wonder if this kid is dreaming or just sitting and thinking and imagining, I think he looks pretty happy about it. There's a, he's looking, there's a castle and I bet there are birds and all sorts of fun, magical things to see. Maybe there's a unicorn. Do you think there might be a unicorn. Parent:		You think the unicorn built the castle.  Parent:		[Page 23] Oh [Child's Name], this, what does this little boy see? What's up here? What do you see? Parent:		A castle. That castle is really far up on the hill. Oh, but look, look at his feet. What do you see? Parent:		You see his tiny toes, and look, he looks really happy. Don't you think? Look at his face? He looks really happy because where do you think he wants to go? Parent:		He wants to go to the castle? Parent:		[Page 23] Oh, this guy, he's got a castle. Parent:		Excited to go to the castle? Parent:		Who do you think lives in that castle? Parent:		A hunting? Parent:		Isn't it though princesses and princes live in the castle? Parent:		So he's must be going to go see the princess and prince. Parent:		Or maybe he is the Prince. And his, the king and queen, the mom and dad are up there waiting for him. Parent:		It's kind of weird that he's walking around without shoes on though, he could hurt his feet. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		He does need shoes. Parent:		Not on his toenies, yeah. His toenies could get hurt without shoes. Parent:		He's going to fly up to the castle? Oh, he's going like that? Yeah, he is going like. He's excited. Parent:		He is funny. Parent:		Next one?

Look at that pretty castle! He was going for a walk today and he stumbled upon this castle. That kind of looks like a toy, doesn't it? But I think he's going to try to finish taking the path up there so he can go play with Rapunzel. [inaudible] Parent:		[Page 23] What's this guy doing? Parent:		I think he's looking for the castle. Maybe a princess? Parent:		Is he looking for Rapunzel? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Oh Snow White? Parent:		[Page 23] He looks like he's in his pajamas, baby dear. We got to look at the pictures. Don't worry about the computer. Okay? Is he in his pajamas? Maybe daydreaming about a castle. That kind of looks like a castle, [inaudible]. Yeah. Parent:		What kind of pajamas is he wearing? He's wearing nice gray pajamas. Thinking of his castle that he's going to one day rule. Parent:		You want to see the friend? Baby we gotta finish this task first and then we'll see our friends, okay? Parent:		Yeah, it's okay. Well, we're going to come back to the our friends in a minute, okay? Parent:		Let's look at the people in here and talk about them as though they're they're our friends.

Parent:		Yeah? Parent:		Okay we'll go to the next one, hold on. Parent:		[Page 23] Oooh, this little boy looks like he's wearing his pajamas and he went walking in a dream in his pajamas and what's that? Parent:		A castle! He found a castle on a mountain. Did he look like he's pretty happy [inaudible]? Looks like he's dreaming. He's fun. He didn't have shoes on [inaudible]. His feet might get hurt. Parent:		But if it's a dream, he probably won't get hurt. Parent:		[Page 23] What's that over there? Is he on a walk to the castle? Parent:		In the mountains. Parent:		There's monsters in the castle? Parent:		What kind of monsters? Parent:		Do they have big teeth? Parent:		Wait, we're not done here. So does he have to go to the mountains to get to the castle? Parent:		Is he going to go be friends with the monsters or is he going to fight them? Parent:		Because they're bad? Parent:		They're bad monsters. Parent:		Is, maybe his friend's in there, he has to go save him? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		Well he can do that. Parent:		Oh, okay. Alright, let's flip the page. Parent:		[Page 23] What's happening here? Parent:		Well, it might not be pajamas. Where's he going? Parent:		I don't know, but where's he going? Parent:		To a castle? Do you think he lives there? Parent:		No, you don't think maybe he's a prince, who lives in the castle? Why not? Parent:		Because maybe his friend lives in the castle. He's going to play with him. Parent:		Yeah? Parent:		[Page 23] And he sees a castle. I think that he's going to go up to the castle. Parent:		[Page 23]. Parent:		Uh, no, I don't think he's a baby. I think he's a boy. What do you think is happening? Parent:		Yeah, I don't think he got hurt. I think, look, I think she's, he or she is excited. Parent:		Yeah. Excited to see the castle, huh?

Parent:		Do you think he's going to go up to the castle? Parent:		He's too big? How can he get up there you think? Parent:		It's not going to happen? Parent:		Oh, Cause he's a big boy and the castles kind of small, huh? Parent:		Is that what you think? Let's see. What's going on here? Parent:		[Page 23] So tell me about this picture. Parent:		Castle and a boy. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Why does he just walk around with no shoes on? Parent:		So he lives in the castle? Parent:		Ohh. Does he look like he is, uh happy? Parent:		Yeah.

You can't be outside without shoes on. Parent:		Yeah, no shoes. But look. They're happy. Parent:		Happy. Parent:		That is a castle. Who lives in castles? Do dragons or princesses live in castles. Parent:		[Page 23] Ooh, look at this boy. He looks like he's in a magical fairy land. He looks excited that he can tip toe through the magic land with the castles. Ooh, that looks so fun. He looks like he's excited to be there. Parent:		[Page 23] Okay. [Other dialogue] This boy is from a fairytale. Mm hmm. He is walking along the path of the fairytale, looking for magic chickens. And he's walking around. He has to sing a song about magic chickens, ""Magic chickens where are you?"" And he sings a song while he walks. And then he comes around the corner and sees a big castle. And he's like, Whoa, that's a great big castle. I wonder if it's filled with magic chickens. So he goes to the castle to see what's in there and you know, what's in there? Chickens, but they're not magic. Wow. Wow. The end. Parent:		[Page 23] [Other dialogue]. Parent:		He does not have shoes on. Why do you think he's barefoot? Parent:		Looks to me like he's still wearing his pajamas. Do you think he's dreaming about going to a castle? Parent:		Maybe that's why he's wearing his pajamas. Yeah. What do you think he wants to do with the castle? Parent:		Oh, he's going to tell the princess that he's scared and having a nightmare. What do you think the princess will do? Parent:		If I were the princess, I would gave him a little hug and say it's okay. I've been scared too. What do you think? It looks like it would be hard to get up there though, huh? He might have to climb those rocks. Would you be brave enough to climb the big rocks to get to the princess? Yeah, that'd be fun. Parent:		[Page 21 or 22] Oh, look at this little boy. What happened to him? Can you tell? Parent:		Looks he spilled something, but look at his pants. They're a little darker right here. What do you think he might have done? Parent:		You think that maybe he wet himself a little bit? Have you done that before? Parent:		Yeah. Look at his face. How do you think he feels about it? Parent:		Yeah. Did you get embarrassed when you got your potty in your pants before? Yeah, but it's okay. Cause accidents happen. Do you think that, who do you think this person is? His mom or dad or something? Parent:		His dad. Do you think his dad is upset or do you think his dad is coming to say it's okay. Parent:		I don't know. I think your daddy would come in and say it's okay. Accidents happen. And then they can clean up the bed and everything will be okay. You just wash the sheets and wash the pants. It's okay. Parent:		[Page 23] Here's Jonathan. Jonathan is going on an adventure, he's exploring in his backyard. And he found in the wilderness, a castle. He wonders what's inside the castle. Jonathan thinks there might be a giant or maybe a dragon. But Jonathan is brave. And Jonathan is very curious about what's inside that castle. He wonders how he can get up there. Parent:		[Page 23] Oh, he looks happy. He wants to go to see the castle, oh look at. Oh, he's in his bare feet. Why do you think he's in his bare feet? Do you think you could climb those, that mountain in his bare feet? I don't think he, I bet you he could, but it might get hurt. Um, he likes, he's cute. Huh? He's a cute kid wanting to go to the castle. He kind of looks like you. Would you go to the castle? Okay. Parent:		[Page 23] What do you see? Oh, it's okay. What do you see? What's that? Parent:		Oh.

Parent:		But there's a castle. Do you think he's going to the castle? Yup. Um, maybe he's going to go up to the top of the castle and sing a song. What song would you sing if you went to the top of the castle? Parent:		Unicorn go or unicorn gold? Parent:		Oh, how does that one go? Parent:		I can't hear it till we get to the top of the castle? Parent:		So I don't get to hear it until we go to a castle. Parent:		Can I hear it now? Parent:		It's long. Parent:		Oh, you think it's going to be too long? Parent:		Could you just sing a little bit of it? Parent:		Wow. Alright. Well, should we keep doing this book then? Parent:		Okay. All right. Let's see what's on the next page. Parent:		[Page 23] Ooh.

Alright, what's this kid in the red shirt look like. It looks like he broke that vase. Parent :		Uh oh. What feeling does he have? Parent :		Does he wants to fix it. Yeah, he wants to fix it. I think he's feeling scared. See this dark picture right here. Parent :		His parents are feeling probably mad, huh? Parent :		You wanna play toys? We're almost done, okay buddy? Parent :		A couple more and then we'll play toys, okay? Parent:		[Page 24] Let's see what happens here. Uh oh, what's going on here? What happened here? Parent:		Like a milk jar? It broke. Didn't it? Parent:		And see the look on his face? I think he feels bad, and maybe kind of scared because it looks like he broke it. Has that happened before where we've broken something at home? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		We have broken things before, huh, haven't we? So he kind of looks like he's scared. Maybe he's afraid he's going to get in trouble for breaking that. Parent:		Oh, he's scared of the, of this guy. Yeah. Parent:		Yeah. That shadow is kinda scary. Huh? Parent:		[Page 24] What's this one? Oh! Is he scared? Parent:		Cause he broke the vase? Oh he broke something. Parent:		He did yeah. Oh no, he broke something. [Other Dialogue]. Parent:		[page 24] what's that one. Parent:		yeah, he broke it? Parent:		Yeah. Parent :		[Page 24] Oh no. He broke the vase. He looks like he's ganna be in trouble. Parent:		[Page 24] Let's see, what should we name this, this boy? Maybe Timothy? Okay. So there was a boy named Timothy. And he was playing with his friend, John, and they were having a lot of fun because it was summer break and school was finally over. And so they were playing and running around the house and mommy made popsicles, cherry popsicles. And so they ran around the backyard and they ate cherry popsicles. Parent:		I did. That's what, that's what Timothy is mommy made too. Was Cherry popsicles. Hey, come back here. Parent:		And then it was time for lunch. So Timothy's mommy said, ""Boys come inside."" And they were so happy because it was summer breaks. And they came running inside and they were wrestling on the floor and running and yelling. And mommy said, ""Boys, calm down before someone gets hurt."" But then she heard a huge crash. And she said, ""Ah, I told you to be quiet. What happened? Tell me what happened!"" And she walked in the room and she saw a broken glass jar that had had some pretty rocks in it. And Timothy looked really upset. And he said, ""Mommy, I'm so sorry. I forgot it was there. I didn't mean to. It was an accident."" His mommy said, ""I told you not to run in the house. This is why we have rules. Timothy, go wash your hands right now and we'll eat lunch."" And then mommy got a broom and she swept up the mess and put the broken glass in a box for the trash man to take. And then they had lunch and they forgot about it. But mommy was still a little sad because she had liked that vase. Parent:		[page 24] Uh oh, Johnny. Did I already had Johnny? Can't remember, this is going to be Johnny. He, what what feeling do you think he is feeling? Parent:		You don't know? Parent:		What do you think? What did he do? Parent:		He dropped a vase and it broke. It was his mommy's favorite vase. So how do you think he's feeling? Parent:		Sad. Yeah, he doesn't really, he thinks he's probably ganna get him in trouble a little bit? Parent:		Yeah. Yeah. So he's not quite sure how to tell his parents because he did something he wasn't supposed to do. Parent:		[page 24] What's ganna happen next? What's ganna happen. Next is this boy is scared. Parent:		And and afraid to tell someone that he broke the vase and the vase broke and he has to come forward and be honest and say it was an accident. He was running around the house on a scooter and bumped into the shelf. And the vase broke. That's happened to us before. Right. Parent:		Daddy broke a picture. He shut the closet door in it. And it broke. And mommy got pretty upset. Huh? Parent:		Yeah. But what did mommy do? She said, it's not a big deal. We can clean it up and get a new picture and a new vase. But in the moment it feels pretty sad and pretty scary because you don't. Parent:		Okay. Well, maybe we can pick one Frozen picture. Parent:		[Page 24] Okay. So Timmy was playing a little too hard one day and he broke Mommy's vase. Uh oh, he looks nervous and scared and like he feels bad for breaking the face. He was nervous to tell Mommy and Daddy. Huh? But that's okay. Cause accidents happen, huh? Yeah. Parent:		Almost there. Parent:		Ope. Parent:		Hang on. We'll take care of those in a minute, okay? Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh what happened here? It looks like there was an accident. What happened? Did he break this vase? Looks like he broke this vase and maybe he's [inaudible]. Does he look scared or something? Parent:		Do you think he's gonna get in trouble? Parent:		Do you get in trouble sometimes too? Parent:		If you break things? Parent:		Yeah, I get mad at you. Looks like they're gonna get mad. Do you think for breaking the vase? Parent:		The little boy's gonna go in time out? Parent:		Get this out of your face? Parent:		[Page] The next one, ooh, he looks happy. Parent:		He has shoes! And he's very excited! HIs hands are up and do you think maybe it's his birthday? Parent:		Or Christmas? Parent:		Well why do you think it's his birthday? Parent:		What's this? New Speaker:		That's my birthday. New Speaker:		Present? Parent:		What do you think is in there? Parent:		A puppy? [inaudible]. Parent:		He looks so happy. It's almost your birthday.  Parent:		[page 24] This boy says, Oh, I think I just broke this vase. Parent:		Yeah. Red shirt. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, what happened here? She accidentally, broke... Parent:		The vase. Parent:		Yeah, it looks like she's a little bit embarrassed and sad and, and, scared she might get in trouble. Parent:		I don't know. She's just kind of standing there going, ""Uh-oh! I didn't mean to break the vase. I hope I don't get into trouble."" I think she'll be okay though. Parent:		[Page 24] This guy was feeling nervous because he knocked over this lamp. He was playing in the house. He knew that he wasn't supposed to throw a ball in the house, but it hit a lamp or a vase and it broke. And here's the parent coming in to say, ""What happened here?"" Parent:		George is feeling kind of scared, because he accidentally knocked over his mom's favorite vase and it broke and look there's George's dad. George's dad says, ""George, what happened? What happened to mom's favorite vase?"" And he's thinking, George is thinking, ""Uh-oh, should I tell the truth? Or should I say that, um, the cat did it?"" And he's thinking, he's trying to decide. What should he do? Should he tell the truth or tell a lie? What should he do? Parent:		So he should tell his dad the truth that he accidentally knocked it over? Parent:		Oh, you think he should tell him the cat did it? Parent:		Well, his cat is not in the room right then? Hmm. Parent:		No, this is in the kitchen. Parent:		He broke the vase. He's scared? Parent:		he's afraid mom and dad are gonna yell at him? ""Why did you break that expensive vase?"" Parent:		[Page 24] Daniel broke a vase. Parent:		How does he feel? Is he embarrassed? Oh-no, I did something wrong. I made a mistake. Parent:		Who's that? Parent:		Dad? Parent:		What's dad going to do? Is dad going to help him clean it up? Parent:		Yeah. Well, how did it break? Did he drop it? Parent:		He goes ""oops!"" and it fell. Parent:		And his dad says, ""It's okay, I'll help you clean it up."" Parent:		What's that say?  Parent:		[Page 24] Oh no! This little boy, maybe he was trying to help somebody and he went to go get a vase because he had some flowers that he wanted to put inside of the vase, but maybe the vase slipped out of his hands. Just like the glass slipped out of mommy's hands this morning and it fell on the ground and it broke and he was a little nervous because he didn't want to break it. Parent:		I hope it didn't hurt his hand. I don't think so. He doesn't have any bandaids like mommy has one on her hands. And, and so he was nervous. He was scared. He didn't want to get into trouble. And so he started to get a little nervous. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh, spaghettio. I don't want my parents to find out I broke something. So now I'm nervous and scared. Parent:		[Page 24] Ooh. This is a story about a boy who has an accident. What happened? Parent:		It does look like he has to go potty. Maybe he does. And then he was running to the bathroom and what? A vase got knocked over! And it was his mom's special vase and that was a mistake. And he's like, ""Oops, I'm embarrassed. Oopsies!"" Parent:		Mhm. Parent:		He's sad? Parent:		Why? does he look scared? Parent:		He's gonna bite his leg? What is that? Parent:		[Page 24] You see this boy? He was playing with vase and he broke it. It fell, it fell, he was carrying it and he fell and he broke. Oh no, and now he's scared. He's scared that he's going to get in trouble. Maybe, that's his dad, but he's thinking, "" Oh what am I going to say to my dad? I broke it. It was an accident."" Parent:		It was an accident. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, James broke the vase and he's scared and he doesn't want to get in trouble. So he's trying to figure out what should happen and what he should do. And. Parent:		yea, he's doing that and he's scared. And he's like, oops, I didn't mean to break it. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, what's happened there? Yeah. There's a shadow there. Is there somebody sitting there? What else do you see? Parent:		The shadow's staring at him? How does he look? Parent:		Do you think he's scared of the shadow? Or was he scared because he broke the vase? Which one? Parent:		That one? Maybe. Yeah, it looks like maybe he's, he's scared cause he broke the vase and he's scared he's going to get in trouble? What do you think? You think this person is going to be mad at him? Hopefully not too mad. Huh? Okay. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, geesh. Got it. Oh no. This kid was just walking around. Then he bumped into something and he said Aye aye aye! And a vase broke. And to me it looks like he's saying, Ooh, sorry. What do you think? Parent:		How do you think this feeling right now? Parent:		You think he's mad? Why do you think he's mad? Parent:		Who's mad? Point at who's mad in the picture. Oh you think He's mad cause he knocked it over. He's mad at who? Somebody else or...? Oh you think this guy knocked it over. I see. Well, what does his face tell you? Bless you. Oh. Cover your mouth when you sneeze you silly goose. Does this face look mad, can you tell me about what his face looks like? His face right here. What does his face look like? Parent:		Yeah, he looks sad to me. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, more embarrassment or discomfort. I see, looks like a broken vase on the ground. I think this, I think this kid feels bad. I think that this kid might be the one who broke the vase because I see another person here. Maybe mom or dad. Do you think you would feel bad if, um, if you broke a vase after I told you not to throw something in the, in the house? Parent:		Yeah. I wonder if his mom or dad told him that he needed to bring his energy level down and he didn't and the vase got broken. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh. Parent:		What happened? Parent:		Yeah. How does he feel? Parent:		Does he feel bad? What, do, like what do you think happened to it? Parent:		Who broke it? Parent:		This guy did? Or this guy? Parent:		Well this guy feels, this guy feels sad. Do you think he broke it? Or him? Parent:		His mommy broke it? So he feels bad about it? Parent:		Oh, he did? Parent:		Oh man. Parent:		What a story. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh Oh. Parent:		It looks like he broke something. Parent:		What does that look like? Parent:		Or no, it's a vase for flowers. Parent:		He broke it. Yeah. So now he's afraid of what maybe mom would be saying or Dad? Because he broke something? Parent:		But I bet it was an accident. Right? Parent:		You spilled your ice cream and it was an accident? Parent:		Yeah, sometimes accidents happen like that. Parent:		On the school? Parent:		Oh, you spilled your ice cream at school? Parent:		Oh. Parent:		Yeah did he make the vase fall too? Parent:		Yeah. He was at home and he made the vase fall and he's really embarrassed. Parent:		Uh Walmart. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		What is it?  Parent:		[Page 24] Hope that's not too fast. Oh no! Little Johnny looks like he has pee. Oh, he broke a base. And so he actually looks scared, cause it looks like he broke a vase and his daddy here is upset that he broke the vase and he's so scared that he has to pee which is why he's crossing his legs. He doesn't know what he's going to do to him. What do we do? First we say, sorry. And then how can I help? Maybe he should [inaudible]. Parent:		[Page 24] What's going on here? Parent:		Oh some glass that broke? A vase? Is that like a flower vase? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		It broke. What happened? How did it break? Do you think? Parent:		Let's turn the next page? You don't want to see what he - what, what happened? Do you think he broke it? Or did he break it? Parent:		He doesn't have any eyes? But what does he feel? What do you think he's feeling? Parent:		Frustrated? Parent:		He's frustrated? Why? Parent:		Oh, he broke it? Oh man, and he's feeling frustrated? Should we turn the page? Parent:		Okay. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh. What happened in this picture? Parent:		You think mommy's mad at her? Parent:		Oh it's a boy? You think mommy's mad at him? Parent:		Yeah. He's pretty scared, huh? Parent:		Oh my goodness. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh! Parent:		Look at what happened there. It broke. It broke and he looks scared, and then his dad. Parent:		All done. All done. Okay. Parent:		Yeah?  Parent:		Gotta go potty? Yeah? You think that's what's going on? Parent:		Why do you think that? Parent:		Oh, did he break it? Parent:		Is he being bad? Parent:		Oh no! Or was it an accident? Parent:		An accident? Parent:		Nope nope. Parent:		[Page 24] We're gonna look at this page. Oh no, what do you think happened here? It looks like... Parent:		It looks like Johnny feels sad. Do you think he broke that vase? Parent:		Yeah, he looks like he broke it. Parent:		And do you think maybe this is his Dad and he's saying, ""I feel sad that I broke the vase [inaudible]"". Yeah. It's okay though, you should always tell the truth, huh? Daddy will always [inaudible]. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh! What happened? Is he scared? Was he playing with a ball and the ball hit the glass and it broke? Parent:		And now he's scared. He said, "" Uh oh, I'm going to get in trouble, huh?"" Parent:		No, not yet. What happens when you do, does he have to go to timeout? Parent:		Yeah. Yeah, how many, how, does he go out for like three minutes? Parent:		Does he have to go sit in the corner? Parent:		Yeah. That's when you're not so careful with the balls, huh? Parent:		Yeah, okay, we can go to the. Parent:		You did, you threw it in a soft place. Not where you could break something, huh? Parent:		Balls you have to play with outside, right? Parent:		Cause it's safe outside. Parent:		Yeah, sometimes [inaudible] cause it can go in the street. Okay, next page. Parent:		[Page 24] This one. Oh, no. He looks kind of sad. Parent:		No, I think cause he, down here, he broke this vase. And he's sad because he broke it. Maybe he's a little bit scared that his mommy or daddy is going to be angry at him for breaking this vase. But I bet it was just an accident. He doesn't need to be scared. What do you think? You don't know? Okay, let's try this one. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh, what happened? What did, what did the boy do? Did he break the glass? Parent:		He broke the vase? Parent:		Yeah. Is he gonna be in trouble? Parent:		Are you scared that mommy's going to be super mad? Parent:		[Page 24]. Aww. Parent:		Aww, what happened? Parent:		And who do you think broke it? Parent:		Maybe a bad guy or something? But maybe he accidentally broke it and now he's really sad and he's kind of scared he broke it. Parent:		Why would he bite a Vase? Parent:		Or do what? Parent:		Step on it. Yeah, I think he might have stepped on it. What do you think he looks like? Parent:		Yeah, I think he's kind of scared. He doesn't want to be in trouble. Parent:		[Page 24] What about this picture? What has happened here? Hmm. [Other dialogue] Right now, let's talk about what's happened here. What has happened in this picture? Parent:		Mm hmm. He's looking a little nervous. What could he be nervous or maybe he's worried. Parent:		You think he's worried about a snake. What? He, he broke the vase, something delicate and something fragile. You think he's worried about telling someone what happened? Could he possibly, could he get in trouble for breaking something? Yeah, but hopefully they'll, they'll have a conversation. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh, what happened? Parent:		And then what happened? Parent:		Got in trouble by who? Parent:		You don't know? Parent:		[Page 24] Uh-Oh. Parent:		Yeah. Did he dump it? So this little boy was running around the house, all crazy and Daddy said, no, no, no. Don't run around the house crazy or you'll break something. Parent:		But he didn't listen. Nope. Didn't listen. And so he was running around the house. When all of the sudden he ran into the table. Parent:		Yeah. And he knocked the lamp over and it broke. Parent:		Well, daddy comes in and said, ""Uh-oh, you didn't listen."" And then he felt bad. Parent:		Yeah. He felt bad. Parent:		[Page 24] Can you tell me what happened? Parent:		Well, look around, what happened? What's going on in the picture? Parent:		He's sad. Why do you think he's sad? Parent:		Well, what's this? Parent:		Did it break? Parent:		Do you think it was supposed to be broken? Nope. Parent:		Yeah. Do you think he was listening to his mom and dad when it broke? Parent:		It broke by itself? Just magically it broke? Parent:		He wasn't doing anything wrong? Hmm. Parent:		[Page 24] What is this? Oh my gosh. This person looks very scared. What do you think they're scared of? What happened? Parent:		He broke that. What do you think that is? Parent:		It looks to me like a vase. Like, you know how mommy has a vase of flowers and stuff. I think he broke that vase. Parent:		I think he broke that vase and it looks like this little kid is either scared or maybe, maybe he thinks his mommy's going to be mad at him for breaking her vase. Do you think that he should run away and hide the vase and pretend he didn't do it? Parent:		You think that's what he should do? Parent:		Just pretend that he didn't do it or do you think he should go and tell his mama he broke her vase? Parent:		Why? Parent:		Well, don't you think it's a better idea to tell someone that you're sorry for breaking their stuff instead of hiding? Parent:		Yeah, probably it's better to just tell the truth. Parent:		Aw, you're right! I'm wearing red. Like that kid. That's so cool. It is hard to tell the truth, especially when you might get in trouble. Parent:		Blue shorts and blue shorts? Oh, this is so fun. They're all matchy matchy. Parent:		[Page 24] Oh, she looks ashamed too. She looked sad that she broke the vase. That's not fun. Parent:		This is the vase. You see remembered that when daddy got mommy flowers. Parent:		Yeah. Daddy got mommy flowers and we had, and that's what it would go in, in a vase. So she looks sad and ashamed and not very happy. Parent:		[Page 24] Alright. What's going on here? Parent:		It does kind of look like he needs to go potty, but what happened over here? Parent:		What is that? Parent:		Broken glass, looks like a broken vase, so maybe he doesn't need to go potty. Maybe he's feeling ashamed? Do you think because he broke this glass? And he's a little bit afraid of the consequences. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh, so this guy's on stage and it looks like he has some stage fright and everybody's throwing things at him. Is that what you think is happening too? Okay. What's the look on his face. Parent:		He's angry. I think he's scared. Parent:		[Page16]. What's happening here? Parent:		Yeah. It's Christmas you think? And he got a present, so he's super excited. Yeah. And he's jumping in happiness. Parent:		[Page 24] And then this guy named Max, look, he's scared. He broke, he broke something, [other dialogue]. Parent:		[Page 24] Uh oh. What happens in this picture? Parent:		What's that? What is that? Parent:		What do you think happened? Parent:		Do you think it broke? Parent:		Do you think he accidentally broke it? Parent:		How's he feeling? Parent:		[Page 24] What happened? Parent:		How does he look? Parent:		What do you think he's scared of? Parent:		A bad man? Parent:		Yeah. Do you think he's scared of that man cause why? Parent:		Cause you're scared? You think he's going to get in trouble cause he broke that? Parent :		[Page 24] Uh-oh. Look. The boy's dad said do not touch. The boy touched and it fell. Oh no. I think he's scared because his daddy's going to say, I told you not to touch the vase. Then he said, I'm sorry, dad. It was an accident. look, he's feeling scared. Parent :		Cause he broke it.

She's afraid, maybe it's gonna bite her. I think it's, maybe she's afraid it's gonna go bite her? Yeah. She's saying, ""No, no no, don't bite me!"" Parent:		You don't think the snake's gonna bite her? You think he's a nice snake? Parent:		You're not scared of him? Parent:		Oh, that's so nice. Parent:		[Page 13] Oh no. And here comes the snake. Does she like snakes? Parent:		No. Do you think she's scared? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 13] She was walking in the forest and she saw a snake, she's scared. Parent:		Snake. Parent:		[Page 2 ] She was eating an ice cream and then her ice cream fell down. Parent:		No ice cream.  Parent:		[Page 13] Ooh.

Parent:		No, come, she looks kind of scared of snakes. Huh? Parent:		[Page 13] Look. She's scared because she doesn't like snakes because they're yucky and gross and slippery and they are gross. Look, she's so scared. She doesn't want to come near it, but the snake doesn't know any boundaries. So it's trying to attack her and it might bite her. Parent:		[Page 13] . Parent:		Oh no, is the snake gonna get him? But she doesn't want the snake to get her she's going, ""No, no, no, no."" Don't get me. Don't get me, snake. Do you need to tell the snake to stop it? Parent:		No, Is the snake just gonna live its life? Parent:		[Page 13] Okay. What about this? Oh my gosh. This, this looks like my worst nightmare. Yikes! What is this? Parent:		A snake! Ahh! She looks, what? Does she look like she's going to go up and give it a hug? No. She looks like mommy. Scared. Oh my gosh. Get away from me! Except I would actually already be running. But what is the safe thing to do when you see a snake? Parent:		Do we just run? No. You back away slowly. We back away, slowly, keep our eyes on it. And then once you get far enough away, then you run. But you back away because they can go like this really fast if you're still close enough. So you want to back away slowly so you don't scare them. And then once you're kind of far enough away, then you run, and then you can be safe. Parent:		[Page 13] Here's Joan. Joan is out on a walk. She went to the mountains. Now, she wanted to go explore, go hike. And she's walking along. She comes across a tree, with a giant green snake hissing in her face. She better hurry along. So the snake doesn't get her.

And she realized there was a snake coming down the branch and she got kind of scared. Ooh! What do you think she's going to do next? What should she do? Parent:		Maybe she should squish it or maybe she should just run away. Just leave it alone. Like chill out. Okay. Let's see what happens. Parent:		[Page 13] Woah. What's going on here? Parent:		A snake. Parent:		A snakey snake snake? This person seems quite afraid of the snake. Do you think that maybe this snake is a poisonous snake? Parent:		Oh my goodness. Or maybe they're just not sure whether it's poisonous or not and it's probably better to be cautious huh? Parent:		[Page 13] Oh my gosh. What's happening here? Parent:		Yeah. And what's this kid saying. Parent:		Stop. Do you think she feels something? Parent:		What does she feel? Parent:		I think so too. Do you think you would be scared if you saw a snake?

Parent:		By ourselves? Parent:		This girl came home and her doggy said, ""Look what I'm eating!"" And it turned out that the dog was eating her favorite teddy bear and she was feeling real mad. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh-oh this girl is Brenna. She's angry, at her puppy. Parent:		Because look, what's the puppy got in his mouth? Parent:		That's a teddy bear. The puppy ate the teddy bear. Parent:		Well, puppies are curious and they like to chew on things to see what they look like or tastes like or are like. Parent:		Oh she's just mean cause she's mad about the teddy bear. Parent:		Her not, she's not mad at the teddy bear, she's mad at the dog for eating the teddy bear. Parent:		Oops. Parent:		Spit it out! Yup. Parent:		Spit it out because the dog has the teddy bear in his mouth. Parent:		[Page 14] What What is happening there? Parent:		He's putting his paws on her, but what's in the dog's mouth? Parent:		Mmm, look carefully. What did he rip up? Parent:		I think he ripped up her stuffed animal. There's a leg of the Teddy bear. Was she happy? Parent:		Yeah, she's mad and angry! Awh, Is that a bad doggy? Parent:		Oh, doggie. Parent:		Bad doggie. Parent :		The bad dog. Okay. He chewed stuffy. [Inaudible]. Does she look angry? Parent :		Would you be angry if you your dog ate your [inaudible] stuffy to? Parent :		That dog looks so sad he was like hey I thought it was my toy. That's my [inaudible]. Parent:		Oh, she's angry at her doggy. What did the doggy do? What's in his mouth? Parent:		Do you see what it is though? Parent:		What is it? Parent:		well, it's her Teddy bear. But Teddy's missing his arm. Look it. Parent:		In the mouth of the doggy, he chewed it all up. What if Snickers ate your bear? Parent:		How would that make you feel? Parent:		Would you be like this girl? Parent:		You wouldn't want Snickers to eat your bear. Parent:		Aw yeah the girl, the girl was just mad at her dog because she got her favorite Teddy bear. Parent:		What? Parent:		Huh? Parent:		Okay, we're looking at this for now, okay? And the girl está angry con her dog. Mira, qué tiene en it's mouth? Parent:		It's a little Teddy bear in it's mouth, she be mad? Parent:		[Inaudible]. Parent:		[Page 14] What do you think this person's feeling? Is she angry? Because the dog chewed up her toy? How would you feel about that? Parent:		Oh, that's bad. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh-oh. Parent:		How does she feel? Parent:		Mad. Why is she mad? What did the dog do? Parent:		Did it chew up her toy? Parent:		Yeah, Rachel is so mad. I guess her dog chewed up her favorite toy. Parent:		Yeah. Do you think that the dog will do that again? Parent:		Yeah cause it's a dog. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh no! What happened here? What happened? Parent:		I think the dog ate her... what is that? Parent:		Oh, how sad? What do you think the teddy bear's name was? Parent:		Hod? Oh gosh, he decided to eat Hod. That is so mean. She is so... Parent:		Angry. She's gotta just scream. Can you see her face? ""Ah I'm so angry!"" Parent:		Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. We can go onto the next one. You want to go on to the next one. Parent:		[Page 14] This one is Alana. This is Alana, okay? Look, and then there's Luna, baby Luna. Parent:		Alana told, Alana told Luna, stop biting all my toys! Cause that's all the toys that I have. And Luna said okay, I will stop biting it. And it's still in the mouth. And Alana said, stop! Luna, stop bitting my stuff! Parent:		Gotta behave, No eating! Parent:		[Page 14] Look, there's another one. Look at this picture. This is Emma and Emma is very upset. Emma, has her favorite Teddy bear that she's had since she was a little girl, but her puppy Roscoe stole the Teddy bear. Oh no. She's very upset. What do we do when we get upset, buddy? What do we do? We say, take deep breaths. Tell her take deep breaths, Huh? That'd be good. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh, it looks like someone's mad at their dog. Why is she mad? He's got a stuffed animal herself, maybe her favorite Teddy bear is in her mouth. Uh oh. Parent:		It's a doggy. Parent:		A doggy And she ate a Teddy bear and her owner is so mad. And she says, Oh, and that was my favorite Teddy bear. So mad at you doggy. Was that a good dog or a bad doggy? Parent:		He behaved bad. Huh? Here, stay here. Let's keep reading. Parent:		Funny? Or is it naughty? Parent:		Yeah, the dog got the Teddy bear and she's so mad. Fists are in balls and she is so angry with him. Maybe he can make it up. Maybe we'll get a new Teddy bear. Huh?  Parent:		[Page 14]. Parent:		Pretty looks like she's yelling at the dog for fighting or eating something that he should not have ate. Parent:		And she looks really, really nice. Parent:		She's trying to tell him that he shouldn't not eat stuff like that. And she's probably telling him that he should spit it out. Parent:		[Page 14] Hmm, Ooh, this person looks really angry. So mad. I see a dog with a stuffed animal and pieces of the stuffed animal on the ground. I think that the dog chewed up one of her toys and she's feeling mad. She's feeling angry. The dog looks a little surprised. I wonder if the dog thinks, if the dog thought that that was the dog's toy. You know how our dog sometimes thinks things are her toys and they're not? Parent:		Or your brother thinks that the dog toy is his. Parent :		[Page 14] Look at here. She looks so mad. Cause the doggie is eating her Teddy bear. That's not okay. That makes her mad. She's so mad. She's going to go put the dog in timeout huh? Parent :		hmmhmm. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh-oh. What's happening here? Parent:		What is the doggy doing? Parent:		Yeah. He bit off part of the toy. He broke it. How does this friend feel about that? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh no! Parent:		Yeah, why? Parent:		Who did? Who got the Teddy bear? Parent:		Why? What, is, is the doggy allowed to have that teddy bear? Parent:		Oh no. Parent:		No. I think that's stuffing. From the teddy bear. From his arm. See? Parent:		Why do you think she's mad about it? Parent:		What do you think she says to the doggy? Parent:		Oh yeah. Is that what you say when you're mad? Parent:		Oh, she says, ""Go to bed."" Parent:		[Page 14] Uh oh. Look what happened! Her doggy... Parent:		Yeah, it looks like her doggy chewed her bear up. Now the bear, his arms and legs are torn off cause the doggy was chewing on it. That made her pretty mad, didn't it? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Maybe if they went for a walk? Yeah, maybe the doggy wouldn't have chewed up the toy if he had something else to do. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh look! This dog has, what's that in his mouth? Parent:		A bear, and it looks like the dog ate the bear. Sometimes our dogs eat our toys. Huh? Parent:		What do you think she's feeling about that? Do you think that was her bear? Or the dog's bear? Parent:		You think so? And she doesn't look very happy. Huh? Parent:		Looks angry. She's like, ""You ate my bear!"" Parent:		Yeah. Do you think they can fix it? No? Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Maybe you sew it back together. Huh? Put some stuffing back in there. The dog looks like, ""Oh! I didn't realize it was your bear."" Hmm? Parent:		[Page 14] Uh oh! She's so mad at the dog! What did you do!? What did the dog do? Parent:		Oh the dog chewed up the little, what is it? A bear? Parent:		She chewed up the bear. Parent:		Yeah, she's so angry like argh! I'm mad at the dog! Parent:		Yeah. That's a dog. Yeah. Come here. Look at what the dog did. Look what the dog did. It ripped the toy and she's mad. She's really mad. You see? She's mad at the dog for ripping the toy. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		[Page 14] What's this one? Parent:		Why is she angry? Parent:		Oh the teddy? Parent:		The puppy ate the teddy? Parent:		Oh no! Parent:		[Page 14] Oh. Parent:		Oh yes. Parent:		She is angry because. Parent:		Her dog chewed up her teddy bear! Look, the pieces of the teddy bear are on the floor and the dog has it in his mouth. He looks like he's trying to give it to her and he's proud of what he did, but she is angry saying, "" Argh, I wish you wouldn't have dropped my Teddy bear."" Parent:		What? Parent:		I think she's probably sad too but her face tells me she's looking angry. Parent:		That is sad. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh, no. What about her? What face is she making? Parent:		An angry face. I think she might be angry at her doggy, because it's got her stuffy. Looks like he tore her stuffy up a little bit. See, there's some more part of her stuffy down there. So she's very mad at him for getting her stuffy. Parent:		Maybe. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh oh, what happened? Parent:		Yeah, she's angry. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh oh. What is going on? Parent:		Who's he? Parent:		The doggy broke the Teddy. And why is she looking the way that she looks? Parent:		Yeah. Look at the plush. It's on the floor at the Teddy's arms and legs are coming off. I wonder who might need to fix it? Parent:		Yeah. Maybe she, maybe she could. That Teddy needs to an animal, to a stuffy hospital. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh, doggie. You got my favorite toy and look, she's all chewed up. Oh, I'm so mad. Parent:		[Page 14] Ooh. This girl looks very angry and kind of mean don't you think? Parent:		So it looks like her puppy, her dog took her Teddy bear and has it in its mouth. Parent:		And she is angry about that. Yeah. She's not happy. Parent:		[Page 14] Uh-oh, how's she feeling? Parent:		Yeah. She's mad. Parent:		Yeah. So one day this little girl walked in and saw her puppy chewing her toy, chewed up the toy. She was so angry. Parent:		Yeah. Cause he chewed up her favorite toy and she broke it. You see all the little pieces, they're all broken. And she was so mad. She told the doggy, no, no, no. Parent:		Yeah. And then she had to clean up the mess and had to fix her toy. Good job! You read all the stories. Good work. [Other dialogue]  Parent:		[Page 14] What's going on here? She's angry. Parent:		What? You tell me me. Tell me the story. Parent:		Mm hmm. And how does she feel about that? Parent:		She's mad. The dog took her stuffy. Does anything happen next in this story right here? Cause every time you turn the pages, it's a new story. Parent:		[Page 14]. Parent:		I know. Look! She's angry because the dog ate her bear. Oh, no, and look, the dog made a mess down there. See, she's really, really upset and angry because the dog ate her Teddy bear. Wow. Parent:		[Page 14] Oh my gosh. This little girl looks upset. Why is she upset? Parent:		Oh. That dog took her Teddy bear. Her dog took her Teddy bear. And what's he doing to it? Parent:		I know, what happened? Look on the floor. What happened to that Teddy? Okay. Parent:		It broke his arms off. What would happen? Would you feel kind of angry like her, if you had a dog that ripped your favorite stuffed animal apart? You would feel a little upset. I would be pretty angry. Now, do you think she should be mean to the dog because he broke her stuff? Parent:		No. We're not mean to people, right when they break stuff, because that doesn't help. That just makes us feel even more angry and it would make that poor dog feel yucky too. And he's not trying to be mean. He's just trying to play. So is, she should probably try to calm down and say, it's okay, accidents happen. Let's try to get a new one. Maybe put it up higher than that fence so the doggy can't find it. Parent:		[Page 14] Margaret. Oh no. Her dog Rufus got her favorite stuffed animal and tore it up. The pieces of the arms and legs are all over the floor. Rufus thought it was his chew toy, but it was really Margaret's favorite stuffed animal from when she was a little, teeny tiny baby. Her aunt Susan gave it to her as a present. And she snuggled with it every night when she went night night. That's why she feels so angry that Rufus got her special, lovey. Parent:		[Page 14] Ooh. Uh oh, look at that doggy. He looks like, uh oh, I made a mistake. I've done something bad. He was chewing on her toy. That little Teddy bear. Huh? And then she get, she got really mad. She's like got, like making an angry face at him. And she's got her hands all clenched. Like, ""Ooh, I'm super angry right now. Cause that was my favorite toy."" He's like, ""I'm so sorry. That was a mistake. Will you forgive me?"" And then she goes, ""Oh, you're so cute with those puppy dog eyes. I just can't help myself. I just love you. But don't do it again."" Right? I think that's what she did. Okay. Let's see. Parent:		[Page 14] Whoa. What happened here? Parent:		Do you think that they're upset? Parent:		No? You don't think so? You don't? What kind of face is that? Parent:		A mad face. What are they mad about? Parent:		The dog, what's the doggie doing? Parent:		Stealing that lady. Stuffy. Huh? And it looks like the stuffy has been ruined. I think I see pieces of the stuffy here. Parent:		Oh my goodness gracious. But it looks like she's using some tactics to calm down and she's balling her fists and saying, ""Errr!"" Like you do at school sometimes when you're upset. Right? If you get really upset. Parent:		Yeah, that doggie ate her Teddy bear. Parent :		I don't think she can give it back. It's ruined. Parent :		Yeah. She looks pretty angry too. Huh? Parent:		[Page 14] Uh oh, what is that? Parent:		It's a puppy dog. Parent:		It looks like, oh no, I see what's happening. Look, the puppy dog has torn up her Teddy bear. You have a bear. Wouldn't you be so mad if, if Raja tore up your bear? Yeah, it make you so sad. Parent:		Yeah. Parent:		Oh yes. She does look mad. She does look mad. The puppy looks a little scared. Like, uh oh. Parent:		[Page 14]. Parent:		What happened? Look at her face. Parent:		Yeah. What is going on? Why do you think she's so angry? Parent:		Because the doggy ate the bear? Do you think it was her favorite bear? Yeah, but the doggy is so cute. Was the, was it okay what the doggy did? No. Cause it was her special bear? Yeah. You think she'll be okay though?
